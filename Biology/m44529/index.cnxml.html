<p id="fs-id2195690">The synthesis of proteins consumes more of a cell&#8217;s energy than any other metabolic process. In turn, proteins account for more mass than any other component of living organisms (with the exception of water), and proteins perform virtually every function of a cell. The process of translation, or protein synthesis, involves the decoding of an mRNA message into a polypeptide product. Amino acids are covalently strung together by interlinking peptide bonds in lengths ranging from approximately 50 amino acid residues to more than 1,000. Each individual amino acid has an amino group (NH<sub>2</sub>) and a carboxyl (COOH) group. Polypeptides are formed when the amino group of one amino acid forms an amide (i.e., peptide) bond with the carboxyl group of another amino acid (<a href="#fig-ch15_05_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). This reaction is catalyzed by ribosomes and generates one water molecule.</p><figure id="fig-ch15_05_01"><figcaption>A peptide bond links the carboxyl end of one amino acid with the amino end of another, expelling one water molecule.

<p id="fs-id2739564">In addition to the mRNA template, many molecules and macromolecules contribute to the process of translation. The composition of each component may vary across species; for instance, ribosomes may consist of different numbers of rRNAs and polypeptides depending on the organism. However, the general structures and functions of the protein synthesis machinery are comparable from bacteria to human cells. Translation requires the input of an mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors.</p>

<p id="fs-id1769427">Even before an mRNA is translated, a cell must invest energy to build each of its ribosomes. In <em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em>, there are  between 10,000 and 70,000  ribosomes present in each cell at any given time. A ribosome is a complex macromolecule composed of structural and catalytic rRNAs, and many distinct polypeptides. In eukaryotes, the nucleolus is completely specialized for the synthesis and assembly of rRNAs.</p><p id="fs-id2000981">Ribosomes exist in the cytoplasm in prokaryotes and in the cytoplasm and rough endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes. Mitochondria and chloroplasts also have their own ribosomes in the matrix and stroma, which look more similar to prokaryotic ribosomes (and have similar drug sensitivities) than the ribosomes just outside their outer membranes in the cytoplasm.  Ribosomes dissociate into large and small subunits when they are not synthesizing proteins and reassociate during the initiation of translation. In <em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em>, the small subunit is described as 30S, and the large subunit is 50S, for a total of 70S (recall that Svedberg units are not additive). Mammalian ribosomes have a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit, for a total of 80S. The small subunit is responsible for binding the mRNA template, whereas the large subunit sequentially binds tRNAs. Each mRNA molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes, all synthesizing protein in the same direction: reading the mRNA from 5' to 3' and synthesizing the polypeptide from the N terminus to the C terminus. The complete mRNA/poly-ribosome structure is called a <span data-type="term">polysome</span>.</p>
</section>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2897379"><h2 data-type="title">tRNAs</h2>
<p id="fs-id1613052">The tRNAs are structural RNA molecules that were transcribed from genes by RNA polymerase III. Depending on the species, 40 to 60 types of tRNAs exist in the cytoplasm. Serving as adaptors, specific tRNAs bind to sequences on the mRNA template and add the corresponding amino acid to the polypeptide chain. Therefore, tRNAs are the molecules that actually &#8220;translate&#8221; the language of RNA into the language of proteins.</p>
<p id="fs-id2853827">Of the 64 possible mRNA codons&#8212;or triplet combinations of A, U, G, and C&#8212;three specify the termination of protein synthesis and 61 specify the addition of amino acids to the polypeptide chain. Of these 61, one codon (AUG) also encodes the initiation of translation. Each tRNA anticodon can base pair with one of the mRNA codons and add an amino acid or terminate translation, according to the genetic code. For instance, if the sequence CUA occurred on an mRNA template in the proper reading frame, it would bind a tRNA expressing the complementary sequence, GAU, which would be linked to the amino acid leucine.</p>
<p id="fs-id3063554">As the adaptor molecules of translation, it is surprising that tRNAs can fit so much specificity into such a small package. Consider that tRNAs need to interact with three factors:  1) they must be recognized by the correct aminoacyl synthetase (see below); 2) they must be recognized by ribosomes; and 3) they must bind to the correct sequence in mRNA.</p></section>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1461234"><h2 data-type="title">Aminoacyl tRNA Synthetases</h2>
<p id="fs-id1720501">The process of pre-tRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase III only creates the RNA portion of the adaptor molecule. The corresponding amino acid must be added later, once the tRNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm. Through the process of tRNA &#8220;charging,&#8221; each tRNA molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by a group of enzymes called <span data-type="term">aminoacyl tRNA synthetases</span>. At least one type of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase exists for each of the 20 amino acids; the exact number of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases varies by species. These enzymes first bind and hydrolyze ATP to catalyze a high-energy bond between an amino acid and adenosine monophosphate (AMP); a pyrophosphate molecule is expelled in this reaction. The activated amino acid is then transferred to the tRNA, and AMP is released.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1986668"><h1 data-type="title">The Mechanism of Protein Synthesis</h1>
<p id="fs-id2334597">As with mRNA synthesis, protein synthesis can be divided into three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. The process of translation is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we&#8217;ll explore how translation occurs in <em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em>, a representative prokaryote, and specify any differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2321391"><h2 data-type="title">Initiation of Translation</h2>
<p id="fs-id1240070">Protein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex. In <em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em>, this complex involves the small 30S ribosome, the mRNA template, three initiation factors (IFs; IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3), and a special <span data-type="term">initiator tRNA</span>, called <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display=""><semantics><mrow>

When an in-frame AUG is encountered during translation elongation, a non-formylated methionine is inserted by a regular Met-tRNA<sup>Met</sup>.</p><p id="fs-id2936033">In <em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em> mRNA, a sequence upstream of the first AUG codon, called the <span data-type="term">Shine-Dalgarno sequence</span> (AGGAGG), interacts with the rRNA molecules that compose the ribosome. This interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal subunit at the correct location on the mRNA template. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is a purine nucleotide triphosphate, acts as an energy source during translation&#8212;both at the start of elongation and during the ribosome&#8217;s translocation.</p>
<p id="fs-id2334805">In eukaryotes, a similar initiation complex forms, comprising mRNA, the 40S small ribosomal subunit, IFs, and nucleoside triphosphates (GTP and ATP). The charged initiator tRNA, called Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>, does not bind fMet in eukaryotes, but is distinct from other Met-tRNAs in that it can bind IFs.</p>
<p id="fs-id3053365">Instead of depositing at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5' end of the mRNA. A cap-binding protein (CBP) and several other IFs assist the movement of the ribosome to the 5' cap. Once at the cap, the initiation complex tracks along the mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, searching for the AUG start codon. Many eukaryotic mRNAs are translated from the first AUG, but this is not always the case. According to <span data-type="term">Kozak&#8217;s rules</span>, the nucleotides around the AUG indicate whether it is the correct start codon. Kozak&#8217;s rules state that the following consensus sequence must appear around the AUG of vertebrate genes: 5'-gccRccAUGG-3'. The R (for purine) indicates a site that can be either A or G, but cannot be C or U. Essentially, the closer the sequence is to this consensus, the higher the efficiency of translation.</p>
<p id="fs-id2682290">Once the appropriate AUG is identified, the other proteins and CBP dissociate, and the 60S subunit binds to the complex of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>, mRNA, and the 40S subunit. This step completes the initiation of translation in eukaryotes.</p>

<p id="fs-id2013469">In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the basics of elongation are the same, so we will review elongation from the perspective of <em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em>. The 50S ribosomal subunit of <em data-effect="italics">E. coli </em>consists of three compartments: the A (aminoacyl) site binds incoming charged aminoacyl tRNAs.

Similarly, the eukaryotic Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>, with help from other proteins of the initiation complex, binds directly to the P site. In both cases, this creates an initiation complex with a free A site ready to accept the tRNA corresponding to the first codon after the AUG.</p><p id="fs-id1313555">During translation elongation, the mRNA template provides specificity. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, each mRNA codon comes into register, and specific binding with the corresponding charged tRNA anticodon is ensured. If mRNA were not present in the elongation complex, the ribosome would bind tRNAs nonspecifically.</p>
<p id="fs-id2608514">Elongation proceeds with charged tRNAs entering the A site and then shifting to the P site followed by the E site with each single-codon &#8220;step&#8221; of the ribosome. Ribosomal steps are induced by conformational changes that advance the ribosome by three bases in the 3' direction. The energy for each step of the ribosome is donated by an elongation factor that hydrolyzes GTP. Peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the A-site tRNA and the carboxyl group of the amino acid attached to the P-site tRNA. The formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by <span data-type="term">peptidyl transferase</span>, an RNA-based enzyme that is integrated into the 50S ribosomal subunit. The energy for each peptide bond formation is derived from GTP hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by a separate elongation factor. The amino acid bound to the P-site tRNA is also linked to the growing polypeptide chain. As the ribosome steps across the mRNA, the former P-site tRNA enters the E site, detaches from the amino acid, and is expelled (<a href="#fig-ch15_05_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Amazingly, the <em data-effect="italics">E. coli </em>translation apparatus takes only 0.05 seconds to add each amino acid, meaning that a 200-amino acid protein can be translated in just 10 seconds.</p>

This reaction forces the P-site amino acid to detach from its tRNA, and the newly made protein is released. The small and large ribosomal subunits dissociate from the mRNA and from each other; they are recruited almost immediately into another translation initiation complex.

<p id="fs-id2979153">During and after translation, individual amino acids may be chemically modified, signal sequences may be appended, and the new protein &#8220;folds&#8221; into a distinct three-dimensional structure as a result of intramolecular interactions.

These sequences at the amino end or the carboxyl end of the protein can be thought of as the protein&#8217;s &#8220;train ticket&#8221; to its ultimate destination. Other cellular factors recognize each signal sequence and help transport the protein from the cytoplasm to its correct compartment. For instance, a specific sequence at the amino terminus will direct a protein to the mitochondria or chloroplasts (in plants). Once the protein reaches its cellular destination, the signal sequence is usually clipped off.</p>

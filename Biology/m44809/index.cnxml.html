<p id="fs-idm250556992">The <span data-type="term">kidneys</span>, illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch41_03_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, are a pair of bean-shaped structures that are located just below and posterior to the liver in the peritoneal cavity. The adrenal glands sit on top of each kidney and are also called the suprarenal glands. Kidneys filter blood and purify it. All the blood in the human body is filtered many times a day by the kidneys; these organs use up almost 25 percent of the oxygen absorbed through the lungs to perform this function. Oxygen allows the kidney cells to efficiently manufacture chemical energy in the form of ATP through aerobic respiration. The filtrate coming out of the kidneys is called <span data-type="term">urine</span>.</p>

<p id="fs-idp79780736">Externally, the kidneys  are surrounded by three layers, illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch41_03_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The outermost layer is a tough connective tissue layer called the <span data-type="term">renal fascia</span>. The second layer is called the <span data-type="term">perirenal fat capsule</span>, which helps anchor the kidneys in place. The third and innermost layer is the <span data-type="term">renal capsule</span>. Internally, the kidney has three regions&#8212;an outer <span data-type="term">cortex</span>, a <span data-type="term">medulla</span> in the middle, and the <span data-type="term">renal pelvis</span> in the region called the <span data-type="term">hilum</span> of the kidney. The hilum is the concave part of the bean-shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney; it is also the point of exit for the ureters. The renal cortex is granular due to the presence of <span data-type="term">nephrons</span>&#8212;the functional unit of the kidney. The medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses, called the <span data-type="term">renal pyramids</span>. In between the pyramids are spaces called <span data-type="term">renal columns</span> through which the blood vessels pass. The tips of the pyramids, called renal papillae, point toward the renal pelvis. There are, on average, eight renal pyramids in each kidney. The renal pyramids along with the adjoining cortical region are called the <span data-type="term">lobes of the kidney</span>. The renal pelvis leads to the <span data-type="term">ureter</span> on the outside of the kidney. On the inside of the kidney, the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major <span data-type="term">calyces</span>, which further branch into the minor calyces. The ureters are urine-bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the <span data-type="term">urinary bladder</span>.</p>

</div><p id="fs-idm58694224">Because the kidney filters blood, its network of blood vessels is an important component of its structure and function. The arteries, veins, and nerves that supply the kidney enter and exit at the renal hilum.

The renal arteries split into several <span data-type="term">segmental arteries</span> upon entering the kidneys. Each segmental artery splits further into several <span data-type="term">interlobar arteries</span> and enters the renal columns, which supply the renal lobes. The interlobar arteries split at the junction of the renal cortex and medulla to form the <span data-type="term">arcuate arteries</span>.

<p id="fs-idm58891360">Kidneys filter blood in a three-step process. First, the nephrons filter blood that runs through the capillary network in the glomerulus. Almost all solutes, except for proteins, are filtered out into the glomerulus by a process called <span data-type="term">glomerular filtration</span>. Second, the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules. Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the PCT by a process called <span data-type="term">tubular reabsorption</span>. In the loop of Henle, the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal medulla and the peritubular capillary network. Water is also reabsorbed during this step.  Then, additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during <span data-type="term">tubular secretion</span>, which is, in essence, the opposite process to tubular reabsorption. The collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae. From here, the papillae deliver the filtrate, now called urine, into the minor calyces that eventually connect to the ureters through the renal pelvis. This entire process is illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch41_03_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p><figure id="fig-ch41_03_04" class=" "><figcaption>Each part of the nephron performs a different function in filtering waste and maintaining homeostatic balance. (1) The glomerulus forces small solutes out of the blood by pressure. (2) The proximal convoluted tubule reabsorbs ions, water, and nutrients from the filtrate into the interstitial fluid, and actively transports toxins and drugs from the interstitial fluid into the filtrate. The proximal convoluted tubule also adjusts blood pH by selectively secreting ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) into the filtrate, where it reacts with H<sup>+</sup> to form NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. The more acidic the filtrate, the more ammonia is secreted.

Almost all nutrients are reabsorbed, and this occurs either by passive or active transport. Reabsorption of water and some key electrolytes are regulated and can be influenced by hormones. Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) is the most abundant ion and most of it is reabsorbed by active transport and then transported to the peritubular capillaries. Because Na<sup>+</sup> is actively transported out of the tubule, water follows it to even out the osmotic pressure. Water is also independently reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries due to the presence of aquaporins, or water channels, in the PCT. This occurs due to the low blood pressure and high osmotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries.

Additionally, the loop of Henle invades the renal medulla, which is naturally high in salt concentration and tends to absorb water from the renal tubule and concentrate the filtrate. The osmotic gradient increases as it moves deeper into the medulla. Because two sides of the loop of Henle perform opposing functions, as illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch41_03_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, it acts as a <span data-type="term">countercurrent multiplier</span>.

    </div><p id="fs-idm65625088">By the time the filtrate reaches the DCT, most of the urine and solutes have been reabsorbed. If the body requires additional water, all of it can be reabsorbed at this point. Further reabsorption is controlled by hormones, which will be discussed in a later section. Excretion of wastes occurs due to lack of reabsorption combined with tubular secretion. Undesirable products like metabolic wastes, urea, uric acid, and certain drugs, are excreted by tubular secretion. Most of the tubular secretion happens in the DCT, but some occurs in the early part of the collecting duct. Kidneys also maintain an acid-base balance by secreting excess H<sup>+</sup> ions.</p>
<p id="fs-idm189006512">Although parts of the renal tubules are named proximal and distal, in a cross-section of the kidney, the tubules are placed close together and in contact with each other and the glomerulus. This allows for exchange of chemical messengers between the different cell types. For example, the DCT ascending limb of the loop of Henle has masses of cells called <span data-type="term">macula densa</span>, which are in contact with cells of the afferent arterioles called <span data-type="term">juxtaglomerular cells</span>. Together, the macula densa and juxtaglomerular cells form the juxtaglomerular complex (JGC). The JGC is an endocrine structure that secretes the enzyme renin and the hormone erythropoietin. When hormones trigger the macula densa cells in the DCT due to variations in blood volume, blood pressure, or electrolyte balance, these cells can immediately communicate the problem to the capillaries in the afferent and efferent arterioles, which can constrict or relax to change the glomerular filtration rate of the kidneys.</p>

<p id="fs-idp25135840"><span data-type="title">Nephrologist</span>A nephrologist studies and deals with diseases of the kidneys&#8212;both those that cause kidney failure (such as diabetes) and the conditions that are produced by kidney disease (such as hypertension). Blood pressure, blood volume, and changes in electrolyte balance come under the purview of a nephrologist.</p>
<p id="fs-idm31711040">Nephrologists usually work with other physicians who refer patients to them or consult with them about specific diagnoses and treatment plans. Patients are usually referred to a nephrologist for symptoms such as blood or protein in the urine, very high blood pressure, kidney stones, or renal failure.</p>
<p id="fs-idm191143760">Nephrology is a subspecialty of internal medicine. To become a nephrologist, medical school is followed by additional training to become certified in internal medicine. An additional two or more years is spent specifically studying kidney disorders and their accompanying effects on the body.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm65665536" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Section Summary</h1><p id="fs-idm292625536">The kidneys are the main osmoregulatory organs in mammalian systems; they function to filter blood and maintain the osmolarity of body fluids at 300 mOsm. They are surrounded by three layers and are made up internally of three distinct regions&#8212;the cortex, medulla, and pelvis.</p>
<p id="fs-idm33870112">The blood vessels that transport blood into and out of the kidneys arise from and merge with the aorta and inferior vena cava, respectively. The renal arteries branch out from the aorta and enter the kidney where they further divide into segmental, interlobar, arcuate, and cortical radiate arteries.</p>
<p id="fs-idm104668096">The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, which actively filters blood and generates urine. The nephron is made up of the renal corpuscle and renal tubule. Cortical nephrons are found in the renal cortex, while juxtamedullary nephrons are found in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla. The nephron filters and exchanges water and solutes with two sets of blood vessels and the tissue fluid in the kidneys.</p>
<p id="fs-idm195125680">There are three steps in the formation of urine: glomerular filtration, which occurs in the glomerulus; tubular reabsorption, which occurs in the renal tubules; and tubular secretion, which also occurs in the renal tubules.</p>

<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-idp14658704" data-label="">
<p id="fs-idm155407552">The loop of Henle is part of the renal tubule that loops into the renal medulla. In the loop of Henle, the filtrate exchanges solutes and water with the renal medulla and the vasa recta (the peritubular capillary network). The vasa recta acts as the countercurrent exchanger. The kidneys maintain the osmolality of the rest of the body at a constant 300 mOsm by concentrating the filtrate as it passes through the loop of Henle.</p>

<p id="fs-idm116210384">Externally, the kidneys are surrounded by three layers. The outermost layer is a tough connective tissue layer called the renal fascia. The second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule, which helps anchor the kidneys in place. The third and innermost layer is the renal capsule. Internally, the kidney has three regions&#8212;an outer cortex, a medulla in the middle, and the renal pelvis in the region called the hilum of the kidney, which is the concave part of the &#8220;bean&#8221; shape.</p>

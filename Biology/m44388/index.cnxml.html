<p id="fs-id1808646">Biology is the science that studies life, but what exactly is life? This may sound like a silly question with an obvious response, but it is not always easy to define life. For example, a branch of biology called virology studies viruses, which exhibit some of the characteristics of living entities but lack others. It turns out that although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases, and even reproduce, they do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define life. Consequently, virologists are not biologists, strictly speaking. Similarly, some biologists study the early molecular evolution that gave rise to life; since the events that preceded life are not biological events, these scientists are also excluded from biology in the strict sense of the term.</p>
<p id="fs-id2248548">From its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with three questions: What are the shared properties that make something &#8220;alive&#8221;? And once we know something is alive, how do we find meaningful levels of organization in its structure? And, finally, when faced with the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that we can better understand them? As new organisms are discovered every day, biologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1396394"><h1 data-type="title">Properties of Life</h1>
<p id="fs-id2137494">All living organisms share several key characteristics or functions: order, sensitivity or response to the environment, reproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation, homeostasis, energy processing, and evolution. When viewed together, these nine characteristics serve to define life.</p><section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2008387"><h2 data-type="title">Order</h2>

</span>
    </figure><p id="fs-id1477381">Organisms are highly organized, coordinated structures that consist of one or more cells. Even very simple, single-celled organisms are remarkably complex: inside each cell, atoms make up molecules; these in turn make up cell organelles and other cellular inclusions. In multicellular organisms (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), similar cells form tissues. Tissues, in turn, collaborate to create organs (body structures with a distinct function). Organs work together to form organ systems.</p>

</span>
    </figure><p id="fs-id2144919">Organisms respond to diverse stimuli. For example, plants can bend toward a source of light, climb on fences and walls, or respond to touch (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals (a process called <em data-effect="italics">chemotaxis</em>) or light (<em data-effect="italics">phototaxis</em>). Movement toward a stimulus is considered a positive response, while movement away from a stimulus is considered a negative response.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-id2890552" class="note interactive" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">Link to Learning</div><span data-type="media" id="fs-id1473369" data-alt="QR Code representing a URL">

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1794075"><h2 data-type="title">Reproduction</h2>
<p id="fs-id1397107">Single-celled organisms reproduce by first duplicating their DNA, and then dividing it equally as the cell prepares to divide to form two new cells. Multicellular organisms often produce specialized reproductive germline cells that will form new individuals. When reproduction occurs, genes containing DNA are passed along to an organism&#8217;s offspring. These genes ensure that the offspring will belong to the same species and will have similar characteristics, such as size and shape.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2890560"><h2 data-type="title">Growth and Development</h2>
<p id="fs-id1962069">Organisms grow and develop following specific instructions coded for by their genes. These genes provide instructions that will direct cellular growth and development, ensuring that a species&#8217; young (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) will grow up to exhibit many of the same characteristics as its parents.</p><figure id="fig-ch01_02_03"><figcaption>Although no two look alike, these kittens have inherited genes from both parents and share many of the same characteristics.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1470518"><h2 data-type="title">Regulation</h2>
<p id="fs-id2195734">Even the smallest organisms are complex and require multiple regulatory mechanisms to coordinate internal functions, respond to stimuli, and cope with environmental stresses. Two examples of internal functions regulated in an organism are nutrient transport and blood flow. Organs (groups of tissues working together) perform specific functions, such as carrying oxygen throughout the body, removing wastes, delivering nutrients to every cell, and cooling the body.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2377700"><h2 data-type="title">Homeostasis</h2>
<figure id="fig-ch01_02_04"><figcaption>Polar bears (<em data-effect="italics">Ursus maritimus</em>) and other mammals living in ice-covered regions maintain their body temperature by generating heat and reducing heat loss through thick fur and a dense layer of fat under their skin.

</span>
    </figure><p id="fs-id2853902">In order to function properly, cells need to have appropriate conditions such as proper temperature, pH, and appropriate concentration of diverse chemicals. These conditions may, however, change from one moment to the next. Organisms are able to maintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly, despite environmental changes, through <span data-type="term">homeostasis</span> (literally, &#8220;steady state&#8221;)&#8212;the ability of an organism to maintain constant internal conditions. For example, an organism needs to regulate body temperature through a process known as thermoregulation. Organisms that live in cold climates, such as the polar bear (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), have body structures that help them withstand low temperatures and conserve body heat. Structures that aid in this type of insulation include fur, feathers, blubber, and fat. In hot climates, organisms have methods (such as perspiration in humans or panting in dogs) that help them to shed excess body heat.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2589720"><h1 data-type="title">Levels of Organization of Living Things</h1>
<p id="fs-id1850530">Living things are highly organized and structured, following a hierarchy that can be examined on a scale from small to large. The <span data-type="term">atom</span> is the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter. It consists of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. Atoms form molecules. A <span data-type="term">molecule</span> is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds. Many molecules that are biologically important are <span data-type="term">macromolecules</span>, large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization (a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers, which are simpler than macromolecules). An example of a macromolecule is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), which contains the instructions for the structure and functioning of all living organisms.</p>

</div><p id="fs-id2074834">Some cells contain aggregates of macromolecules surrounded by membranes; these are called <span data-type="term">organelles</span>. Organelles are small structures that exist within cells. Examples of organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts, which carry out indispensable functions: mitochondria produce energy to power the cell, while chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize the energy in sunlight to make sugars. All living things are made of cells; the <span data-type="term">cell</span> itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms. (This requirement is why viruses are not considered living: they are not made of cells. To make new viruses, they have to invade and hijack the reproductive mechanism of a living cell; only then can they obtain the materials they need to reproduce.) Some organisms consist of a single cell and others are multicellular. Cells are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic. <span data-type="term">Prokaryotes</span> are single-celled or colonial organisms that do not have membrane-bound nuclei; in contrast, the cells of <span data-type="term">eukaryotes</span> do have membrane-bound organelles and a membrane-bound nucleus.</p>
<p id="fs-id2155753">In larger organisms, cells combine to make <span data-type="term">tissues</span>, which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions. <span data-type="term">Organs</span> are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function. Organs are present not only in animals but also in plants. An <span data-type="term">organ system</span> is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related organs. Mammals have many organ systems. For instance, the circulatory system transports blood through the body and to and from the lungs; it includes organs such as the heart and blood vessels. <span data-type="term">Organisms</span> are individual living entities. For example, each tree in a forest is an organism. Single-celled prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes are also considered organisms and are typically referred to as microorganisms.</p>
<p id="eip-622">All the individuals of a species living within a specific area are collectively called a <span data-type="term">population</span>. For example, a forest may include many pine trees. All of these pine trees represent the population of pine trees in this forest. Different populations may live in the same specific area. For example, the forest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants and also insects and microbial populations. A <span data-type="term">community</span> is the sum of populations inhabiting a particular area. For instance, all of the trees, flowers, insects, and other populations in a forest form the forest&#8217;s community. The forest itself is an ecosystem. An <span data-type="term">ecosystem</span> consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the abiotic, non-living parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rain water. At the highest level of organization (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_07" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), the <span data-type="term">biosphere</span> is the collection of all ecosystems, and it represents the zones of life on earth. It includes land, water, and even the atmosphere to a certain extent.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-id1429210" class="note art-connection" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">Art Connection</div><figure id="fig-ch01_02_07"><figcaption>The biological levels of organization of living things are shown.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1912612"><h1 data-type="title">The Diversity of Life</h1>
<p id="fs-id1957422">The fact that biology, as a science, has such a broad scope has to do with the tremendous diversity of life on earth. The source of this diversity is <span data-type="term">evolution</span>, the process of gradual change during which new species arise from older species. Evolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystems.</p>
<p id="fs-id2199492">The evolution of various life forms on Earth can be summarized in a phylogenetic tree (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_08" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). A <span data-type="term">phylogenetic tree</span> is a diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among biological species based on similarities and differences in genetic or physical traits or both. A phylogenetic tree is composed of nodes and branches. The internal nodes represent ancestors and are points in evolution when, based on scientific evidence, an ancestor is thought to have diverged to form two new species. The length of each branch is proportional to the time elapsed since the split.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch01_02_08"><figcaption>This phylogenetic tree was constructed by microbiologist Carl Woese using data obtained from sequencing ribosomal RNA genes. The tree shows the separation of living organisms into three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Bacteria and Archaea are prokaryotes, single-celled organisms lacking intracellular organelles.

    <p id="fs-id2024686"><span data-type="title">Carl Woese and the Phylogenetic Tree</span>In the past, biologists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria. The organizational scheme was based mainly on physical features, as opposed to physiology, biochemistry, or molecular biology, all of which are used by modern systematics. The pioneering work of American microbiologist Carl Woese in the early 1970s has shown, however, that life on Earth has evolved along three lineages, now called domains&#8212;Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The first two are prokaryotic cells with microbes that lack membrane-enclosed nuclei and organelles. The third domain contains the eukaryotes and includes unicellular microorganisms together with the four original kingdoms (excluding bacteria). Woese defined Archaea as a new domain, and this resulted in a new taxonomic tree (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_08" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Many organisms belonging to the Archaea domain live under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles. To construct his tree, Woese used genetic relationships rather than similarities based on morphology (shape).</p>
    <p id="fs-id2956594">Woese&#8217;s tree was constructed from comparative sequencing of the genes that are universally distributed, present in every organism, and conserved (meaning that these genes have remained essentially unchanged throughout evolution). Woese&#8217;s approach was revolutionary because comparisons of physical features are insufficient to differentiate between the prokaryotes that appear fairly similar in spite of their tremendous biochemical diversity and genetic variability (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_09" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The comparison of homologous DNA and RNA sequences provided Woese with a sensitive device that revealed the extensive variability of prokaryotes, and which justified the separation of the prokaryotes into two domains: bacteria and archaea.</p><figure id="fig-ch01_02_09" data-orient="vertical"><figcaption>These images represent different domains.

Forensic scientists provide scientific evidence for use in courts, and their job involves examining trace materials associated with crimes. Interest in forensic science has increased in the last few years, possibly because of popular television shows that feature forensic scientists on the job. Also, the development of molecular techniques and the establishment of DNA databases have expanded the types of work that forensic scientists can do. Their job activities are primarily related to crimes against people such as murder, rape, and assault. Their work involves analyzing samples such as hair, blood, and other body fluids and also processing DNA (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_10" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) found in many different environments and materials. Forensic scientists also analyze other biological evidence left at crime scenes, such as insect larvae or pollen grains.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1703103" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Section Summary</h1><p id="fs-id1318474">Biology is the science of life. All living organisms share several key properties such as order, sensitivity or response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development, regulation, homeostasis, and energy processing. Living things are highly organized parts of a hierarchy that includes atoms, molecules, organelles, cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems. Organisms, in turn, are grouped as populations, communities, ecosystems, and the biosphere. The great diversity of life today evolved from less-diverse ancestral organisms over billions of years. A diagram called a phylogenetic tree can be used to show evolutionary relationships among organisms.</p><p id="fs-id1467930">Biology is very broad and includes many branches and subdisciplines. Examples include molecular biology, microbiology, neurobiology, zoology, and botany, among others.</p>

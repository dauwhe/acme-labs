<p id="fs-idp12633056">Sexual reproduction takes place with slight variations in different groups of plants. Plants have two distinct stages in their lifecycle: the gametophyte stage and the sporophyte stage. The haploid <span data-type="term">gametophyte</span> produces the male and female gametes by mitosis in distinct multicellular structures. Fusion of the male and females gametes forms the diploid zygote, which develops into the <span data-type="term">sporophyte</span>. After reaching maturity, the diploid sporophyte produces spores by meiosis, which in turn divide by mitosis to produce the haploid gametophyte. The new gametophyte produces gametes, and the cycle continues. This is the alternation of generations, and is typical of plant reproduction (<a href="#fig-ch32_01_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

The flower is borne on a stalk known as a receptacle. Flower shape, color, and size are unique to each species, and are often used by taxonomists to classify plants.</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp12182032"><h1 data-type="title">Sexual Reproduction in Angiosperms</h1>

<p id="fs-idm123612080">A typical flower has four main parts&#8212;or whorls&#8212;known as the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium (<a href="#fig-ch32_01_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The outermost whorl of the flower has green, leafy structures known as sepals. The sepals, collectively called the calyx, help to protect the unopened bud. The second whorl is comprised of petals&#8212;usually, brightly colored&#8212;collectively called the corolla. The number of sepals and petals varies depending on whether the plant is a monocot or dicot. In monocots, petals usually number three or multiples of three; in dicots, the number of petals is four or five, or multiples of four and five. Together, the calyx and corolla are known as the <span data-type="term">perianth</span>. The third whorl contains the male reproductive structures and is known as the androecium. The <span data-type="term">androecium</span> has stamens with anthers that contain the microsporangia. The innermost group of structures in the flower is the <span data-type="term">gynoecium</span>, or the female reproductive component(s). The carpel is the individual unit of the gynoecium and has a stigma, style, and ovary. A flower may have one or multiple carpels.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-idm70503296" class="note art-connection" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">Art Connection</div>

The microsporangia, which are usually bi-lobed, are pollen sacs in which the microspores develop into pollen grains.

First, in the process of <span data-type="term">megasporogenesis</span>, a single cell in the diploid <span data-type="term">megasporangium</span>&#8212;an area of tissue in the ovules&#8212;undergoes meiosis to produce four megaspores, only one of which survives. During the second phase, <span data-type="term">megagametogenesis</span>, the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight-nucleate, seven-cell female gametophyte, also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac. Two of the nuclei&#8212;the <span data-type="term">polar nuclei</span>&#8212;move to the equator and fuse, forming a single, diploid central cell. This central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm. Three nuclei position themselves on the end of the embryo sac opposite the micropyle and develop into the <span data-type="term">antipodal</span> cells, which later degenerate.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-idm28890784"><h2 data-type="title">Reproductive Process</h2>
<p id="fs-idm134502480">Upon landing on the female cone, the tube cell of the pollen forms the pollen tube, through which the generative cell migrates towards the female gametophyte through the micropyle. It takes approximately one year for the pollen tube to grow and migrate towards the female gametophyte. The male gametophyte containing the generative cell splits into two sperm nuclei, one of which fuses with the egg, while the other degenerates. After fertilization of the egg, the diploid zygote is formed, which divides by mitosis to form the embryo. The scales of the cones are closed during development of the seed. The seed is covered by a seed coat, which is derived from the female sporophyte. Seed development takes another one to two years. Once the seed is ready to be dispersed, the bracts of the female cones open to allow the dispersal of seed; no fruit formation takes place because gymnosperm seeds have no covering.</p></section>

<p id="fs-idm59623456">Gymnosperm reproduction differs from that of angiosperms in several ways (<a href="#fig-ch32_01_10" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). In angiosperms, the female gametophyte exists in an enclosed structure&#8212;the ovule&#8212;which is within the ovary; in gymnosperms, the female gametophyte is present on exposed bracts of the female cone. Double fertilization is a key event in the lifecycle of angiosperms, but is completely absent in gymnosperms. The male and female gametophyte structures are present on separate male and female cones in gymnosperms, whereas in angiosperms, they are a part of the flower. Lastly, wind plays an important role in pollination in gymnosperms because pollen is blown by the wind to land on the female cones. Although many angiosperms are also wind-pollinated, animal pollination is more common.</p><figure id="fig-ch32_01_10" class=" "><figcaption>(a) Angiosperms are flowering plants, and include grasses, herbs, shrubs and most deciduous trees, while (b) gymnosperms are conifers.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm132005392" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Section Summary</h1><p id="fs-idm50056544">The flower contains the reproductive structures of a plant. All complete flowers contain four whorls: the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium. The stamens are made up of anthers, in which pollen grains are produced, and a supportive strand called the filament. The pollen contains two cells&#8212; a generative cell and a tube cell&#8212;and is covered by two layers called the intine and the exine. The carpels, which are the female reproductive structures, consist of the stigma, style, and ovary. The female gametophyte is formed from mitotic divisions of the megaspore, forming an eight-nuclei ovule sac. This is covered by a layer known as the integument. The integument contains an opening called the micropyle, through which the pollen tube enters the embryo sac.</p>
<p id="fs-idm172193008">The diploid sporophyte of angiosperms and gymnosperms is the conspicuous and long-lived stage of the life cycle.  The sporophytes differentiate specialized reproductive structures called sporangia, which are dedicated to the production of spores.  The microsporangium contains microspore mother cells, which divide by meiosis to produce haploid microspores.  The microspores develop into male gametophytes that are released as pollen.  The megasporangium contains megaspore mother cells, which divide by meiosis to produce haploid megaspores.  A megaspore develops into a female gametophyte containing a haploid egg.  A new diploid sporophyte is formed when a male gamete from a pollen grain enters the ovule sac and fertilizes this egg.</p></section>

<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-idm40105088" data-label="">
<p id="fs-idm143300912">Plants have two distinct phases in their lifecycle: the gametophyte stage and the sporophyte stage. In the gametophyte stage, when reproductive cells undergo meiosis and produce haploid cells called spores, the gametophyte stage begins. Spores divide by cell division to form plant structures of an entirely new plant. The cells in these structures or plants are haploid. Some of these cells undergo cell division and form sex cells. Fertilization, the joining of haploid sex cells, begins the sporophyte stage. Cells formed in this stage have the diploid number of chromosomes. Meiosis in some of these cells forms spores, and the cycle begins again: a process known as alternation of generations.</p>

<p id="fs-idm55132656">A typical flower has four main parts, or whorls: the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium. The outermost whorl of the flower has green, leafy structures known as sepals, which are collectively called the calyx. It helps to protect the unopened bud. The second whorl is made up of brightly colored petals that are known collectively as the corolla. The third whorl is the male reproductive structure known as the androecium. The androecium has stamens, which have anthers on a stalk or filament. Pollen grains are borne on the anthers. The gynoecium is the female reproductive structure. The carpel is the individual structure of the gynoecium and has a stigma, the stalk or style, and the ovary.</p>

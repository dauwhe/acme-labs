<p id="fs-id1428511">The <span data-type="term">cell cycle</span> is an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells. Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth, DNA replication, and division that produces two identical (clone) cells. The cell cycle has two major phases: interphase and the mitotic phase (<a href="#fig-ch10_02_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). During <span data-type="term">interphase</span>, the cell grows and DNA is replicated.

<p id="fs-id1712664">During interphase, the cell undergoes normal growth processes while also preparing for cell division. In order for a cell to move from interphase into the mitotic phase, many internal and external conditions must be met. The three stages of interphase are called G<sub>1</sub>, S, and G<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2013371"><h2 data-type="title">G<sub>1</sub> Phase (First Gap)</h2>
<p id="fs-id2955338">The first stage of interphase is called the <span data-type="term">G<sub>1</sub> phase</span> (first gap) because, from a microscopic aspect, little change is visible. However, during the G<sub>1</sub> stage, the cell is quite active at the biochemical level. The cell is accumulating the building blocks of chromosomal DNA and the associated proteins as well as accumulating sufficient energy reserves to complete the task of replicating each chromosome in the nucleus.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2228970"><h2 data-type="title">S Phase (Synthesis of DNA)</h2>
<p id="fs-id1798381">Throughout interphase, nuclear DNA remains in a semi-condensed chromatin configuration. In the <span data-type="term">S phase</span>, DNA replication can proceed through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of DNA molecules&#8212;sister chromatids&#8212;that are firmly attached to the centromeric region. The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase. The two centrosomes will give rise to the <span data-type="term">mitotic spindle</span>, the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis. At the center of each animal cell, the centrosomes of animal cells are associated with a pair of rod-like objects, the <span data-type="term">centrioles</span>, which are at right angles to each other. Centrioles help organize cell division. Centrioles are not present in the centrosomes of other eukaryotic species, such as plants and most fungi.</p>

<p id="fs-id1760961">In the <span data-type="term">G<sub>2</sub> phase</span>, the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation.

The nucleolus disappears (disperses). The centrosomes begin to move to opposite poles of the cell. Microtubules that will form the mitotic spindle extend between the centrosomes, pushing them farther apart as the microtubule fibers lengthen.

The remnants of the nuclear envelope fragment. The mitotic spindle continues to develop as more microtubules assemble and stretch across the length of the former nuclear area. Chromosomes become more condensed and discrete. Each sister chromatid develops a protein structure called a <span data-type="term">kinetochore</span> in the centromeric region (<a href="#fig-ch10_02_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The proteins of the kinetochore attract and bind mitotic spindle microtubules. As the spindle microtubules extend from the centrosomes, some of these microtubules come into contact with and firmly bind to the kinetochores. Once a mitotic fiber attaches to a chromosome, the chromosome will be oriented until the kinetochores of sister chromatids face the opposite poles. Eventually, all the sister chromatids will be attached via their kinetochores to microtubules from opposing poles. Spindle microtubules that do not engage the chromosomes are called polar microtubules. These microtubules overlap each other midway between the two poles and contribute to cell elongation. Astral microtubules are located near the poles, aid in spindle orientation, and are required for the regulation of mitosis.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1597195"><h2 data-type="title">Cytokinesis</h2>
<p id="fs-id2022386"><span data-type="term">Cytokinesis</span>, or &#8220;cell motion,&#8221; is the second main stage of the mitotic phase during which cell division is completed via the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells. Division is not complete until the cell components have been apportioned and completely separated into the two daughter cells. Although the stages of mitosis are similar for most eukaryotes, the process of cytokinesis is quite different for eukaryotes that have cell walls, such as plant cells.</p>
    <p id="fs-id2199309">In cells such as animal cells that lack cell walls, cytokinesis follows the onset of anaphase. A contractile ring composed of actin filaments forms just inside the plasma membrane at the former metaphase plate. The actin filaments pull the equator of the cell inward, forming a fissure. This fissure, or &#8220;crack,&#8221; is called the <span data-type="term">cleavage furrow</span>. The furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts, and eventually the membrane is cleaved in two (<a href="#fig-ch10_02_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p><p id="fs-id1466552">In plant cells, a new cell wall must form between the daughter cells. During interphase, the Golgi apparatus accumulates enzymes, structural proteins, and glucose molecules prior to breaking into vesicles and dispersing throughout the dividing cell.

There, the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the center toward the cell walls; this structure is called a <span data-type="term">cell plate</span>. As more vesicles fuse, the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell walls at the periphery of the cell. Enzymes use the glucose that has accumulated between the membrane layers to build a new cell wall. The Golgi membranes become parts of the plasma membrane on either side of the new cell wall (<a href="#fig-ch10_02_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p><figure id="fig-ch10_02_04"><figcaption>During cytokinesis in animal cells, a ring of actin filaments forms at the metaphase plate.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2000135" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Section Summary</h1><p id="fs-id1519661">The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events. Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages. In eukaryotes, the cell cycle consists of a long preparatory period, called interphase. Interphase is divided into G<sub>1</sub>, S, and G<sub>2</sub> phases. The mitotic phase begins with karyokinesis (mitosis), which consists of five stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The final stage of the mitotic phase is cytokinesis, during which the cytoplasmic components of the daughter cells are separated either by an actin ring (animal cells) or by cell plate formation (plant cells).</p>

<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-id1807819" data-label="">
<p id="fs-id2988594">The mitotic spindle is formed of microtubules. Microtubules are polymers of the protein tubulin; therefore, it is the mitotic spindle that is disrupted by these drugs. Without a functional mitotic spindle, the chromosomes will not be sorted or separated during mitosis. The cell will arrest in mitosis and die.</p>

<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-id1831126" data-label="">
<p id="fs-id1397026">There are very few similarities between animal cell and plant cell cytokinesis. In animal cells, a ring of actin fibers is formed around the periphery of the cell at the former metaphase plate (cleavage furrow). The actin ring contracts inward, pulling the plasma membrane toward the center of the cell until the cell is pinched in two. In plant cells, a new cell wall must be formed between the daughter cells. Due to the rigid cell walls of the parent cell, contraction of the middle of the cell is not possible. Instead, a phragmoplast first forms. Subsequently, a cell plate is formed in the center of the cell at the former metaphase plate. The cell plate is formed from Golgi vesicles that contain enzymes, proteins, and glucose. The vesicles fuse and the enzymes build a new cell wall from the proteins and glucose. The cell plate grows toward and eventually fuses with the cell wall of the parent cell.</p>

<p id="fs-id1889801">Many cells temporarily enter G<sub>0</sub> until they reach maturity.

<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-id2235183" data-label="">
<p id="fs-id1439212">If cohesin is not functional, chromosomes are not packaged after DNA replication in the S phase of interphase. It is likely that the proteins of the centromeric region, such as the kinetochore, would not form. Even if the mitotic spindle fibers could attach to the chromatids without packing, the chromosomes would not be sorted or separated during mitosis.</p>

<para id="fs-id1428511">The <term>cell cycle</term> is an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells. Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth, DNA replication, and division that produces two identical (clone) cells. The cell cycle has two major phases: interphase and the mitotic phase (<link target-id="fig-ch10_02_01" document=""/>). During <term>interphase</term>, the cell grows and DNA is replicated. During the <term>mitotic phase</term>, the replicated DNA and cytoplasmic contents are separated, and the cell divides.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch10_02_01" class=" "><media id="fs-id2008544" alt="Like a clock, the cell cycles from interphase to the mitotic phase and back to interphase. Most of the cell cycle is spent in interphase, which is subdivided into G_{1}, S, and G_{2} phases. Cell growth occurs during G_{1}, DNA synthesis occurs during S, and more growth occurs during G_{2}. The mitotic phase consists of mitosis, in which the nuclear chromatin is divided, and cytokinesis, in which the cytoplasm is divided, resulting in two daughter cells.">

<caption>The cell cycle consists of interphase and the mitotic phase. During interphase, the cell grows and the nuclear DNA is duplicated. Interphase is followed by the mitotic phase. During the mitotic phase, the duplicated chromosomes are segregated and distributed into daughter nuclei. The cytoplasm is usually divided as well, resulting in two daughter cells.</caption></figure><section id="fs-id2891070">
<title>Interphase</title>
<para id="fs-id1712664">During interphase, the cell undergoes normal growth processes while also preparing for cell division. In order for a cell to move from interphase into the mitotic phase, many internal and external conditions must be met. The three stages of interphase are called G<sub>1</sub>, S, and G<sub>2</sub>.</para>
<section id="fs-id2013371">
<title>G<sub>1</sub> Phase (First Gap)</title>
<para id="fs-id2955338">The first stage of interphase is called the <term>G<sub>1</sub> phase</term> (first gap) because, from a microscopic aspect, little change is visible. However, during the G<sub>1</sub> stage, the cell is quite active at the biochemical level. The cell is accumulating the building blocks of chromosomal DNA and the associated proteins as well as accumulating sufficient energy reserves to complete the task of replicating each chromosome in the nucleus.</para>
</section>
<section id="fs-id2228970">
<title>S Phase (Synthesis of DNA)</title>
<para id="fs-id1798381">Throughout interphase, nuclear DNA remains in a semi-condensed chromatin configuration. In the <term>S phase</term>, DNA replication can proceed through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of DNA molecules&#8212;sister chromatids&#8212;that are firmly attached to the centromeric region. The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase. The two centrosomes will give rise to the <term>mitotic spindle</term>, the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis. At the center of each animal cell, the centrosomes of animal cells are associated with a pair of rod-like objects, the <term>centrioles</term>, which are at right angles to each other. Centrioles help organize cell division. Centrioles are not present in the centrosomes of other eukaryotic species, such as plants and most fungi.</para>

<title>G<sub>2</sub> Phase (Second Gap)</title>
<para id="fs-id1760961">In the <term>G<sub>2</sub> phase</term>, the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation. Some cell organelles are duplicated, and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to provide resources for the mitotic phase. There may be additional cell growth during G<sub>2</sub>. The final preparations for the mitotic phase must be completed before the cell is able to enter the first stage of mitosis.</para>

Chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate and each sister chromatid is attached to a spindle fiber originating from the opposite pole. During anaphase, the cohesin proteins that were binding the sister chromatids together break down. The sister chromatids, which are now called chromosomes, move toward opposite poles of the cell. Non-kinetochore spindle fibers lengthen, elongating the cell. During telophase, chromosomes arrive at the opposite poles and begin to decondense. The nuclear envelope reforms. During cytokinesis in animals, a cleavage furrow separates the two daughter cells. In plants, a cell plate separates the two cells.">

The nucleolus disappears (disperses). The centrosomes begin to move to opposite poles of the cell. Microtubules that will form the mitotic spindle extend between the centrosomes, pushing them farther apart as the microtubule fibers lengthen. The sister chromatids begin to coil more tightly with the aid of <term>condensin</term> proteins and become visible under a light microscope.</para>

The remnants of the nuclear envelope fragment. The mitotic spindle continues to develop as more microtubules assemble and stretch across the length of the former nuclear area. Chromosomes become more condensed and discrete. Each sister chromatid develops a protein structure called a <term>kinetochore</term> in the centromeric region (<link target-id="fig-ch10_02_03" document=""/>). The proteins of the kinetochore attract and bind mitotic spindle microtubules. As the spindle microtubules extend from the centrosomes, some of these microtubules come into contact with and firmly bind to the kinetochores. Once a mitotic fiber attaches to a chromosome, the chromosome will be oriented until the kinetochores of sister chromatids face the opposite poles. Eventually, all the sister chromatids will be attached via their kinetochores to microtubules from opposing poles. Spindle microtubules that do not engage the chromosomes are called polar microtubules. These microtubules overlap each other midway between the two poles and contribute to cell elongation. Astral microtubules are located near the poles, aid in spindle orientation, and are required for the regulation of mitosis.</para>

Nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes, and nucleosomes appear within the nuclear area.</para>

<title>Cytokinesis</title>
<para id="fs-id2022386"><term>Cytokinesis</term>, or &#8220;cell motion,&#8221; is the second main stage of the mitotic phase during which cell division is completed via the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells. Division is not complete until the cell components have been apportioned and completely separated into the two daughter cells. Although the stages of mitosis are similar for most eukaryotes, the process of cytokinesis is quite different for eukaryotes that have cell walls, such as plant cells.</para>
    <para id="fs-id2199309">In cells such as animal cells that lack cell walls, cytokinesis follows the onset of anaphase. A contractile ring composed of actin filaments forms just inside the plasma membrane at the former metaphase plate. The actin filaments pull the equator of the cell inward, forming a fissure. This fissure, or &#8220;crack,&#8221; is called the <term>cleavage furrow</term>. The furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts, and eventually the membrane is cleaved in two (<link target-id="fig-ch10_02_04" document=""/>).</para><para id="fs-id1466552">In plant cells, a new cell wall must form between the daughter cells. During interphase, the Golgi apparatus accumulates enzymes, structural proteins, and glucose molecules prior to breaking into vesicles and dispersing throughout the dividing cell. During telophase, these Golgi vesicles are transported on microtubules to form a phragmoplast (a vesicular structure) at the metaphase plate. There, the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the center toward the cell walls; this structure is called a <term>cell plate</term>. As more vesicles fuse, the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell walls at the periphery of the cell. Enzymes use the glucose that has accumulated between the membrane layers to build a new cell wall. The Golgi membranes become parts of the plasma membrane on either side of the new cell wall (<link target-id="fig-ch10_02_04" document=""/>).</para><figure id="fig-ch10_02_04"><media id="fs-id1962069" alt="Part a: This illustration shows cytokinesis in a typical animal cell.

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-id1519661">The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events. Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages. In eukaryotes, the cell cycle consists of a long preparatory period, called interphase. Interphase is divided into G<sub>1</sub>, S, and G<sub>2</sub> phases. The mitotic phase begins with karyokinesis (mitosis), which consists of five stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The final stage of the mitotic phase is cytokinesis, during which the cytoplasmic components of the daughter cells are separated either by an actin ring (animal cells) or by cell plate formation (plant cells).</para>

<solution id="fs-id1831126"><label/>
<para id="fs-id1397026">There are very few similarities between animal cell and plant cell cytokinesis. In animal cells, a ring of actin fibers is formed around the periphery of the cell at the former metaphase plate (cleavage furrow). The actin ring contracts inward, pulling the plasma membrane toward the center of the cell until the cell is pinched in two. In plant cells, a new cell wall must be formed between the daughter cells. Due to the rigid cell walls of the parent cell, contraction of the middle of the cell is not possible. Instead, a phragmoplast first forms. Subsequently, a cell plate is formed in the center of the cell at the former metaphase plate. The cell plate is formed from Golgi vesicles that contain enzymes, proteins, and glucose. The vesicles fuse and the enzymes build a new cell wall from the proteins and glucose. The cell plate grows toward and eventually fuses with the cell wall of the parent cell.</para>

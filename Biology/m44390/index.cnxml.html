<p id="fs-idp140338804205648">At its most fundamental level, life is made up of matter. <span data-type="term">Matter</span> is any substance that occupies space and has mass. <span data-type="term">Elements</span> are unique forms of matter with specific chemical and physical properties that cannot be broken down into smaller substances by ordinary chemical reactions. There are 118 elements, but only 92 occur naturally. The remaining elements are synthesized in laboratories and are unstable.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338796754528">Each element is designated by its chemical symbol, which is a single capital letter or, when the first letter is already &#8220;taken&#8221; by another element, a combination of two letters. Some elements follow the English term for the element, such as C for carbon and Ca for calcium. Other elements&#8217; chemical symbols derive from their Latin names; for example, the symbol for sodium is Na, referring to <em data-effect="italics">natrium</em>, the Latin word for sodium.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338796747920">The four elements common to all living organisms are oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N). In the non-living world, elements are found in different proportions, and some elements common to living organisms are relatively rare on the earth as a whole, as shown in <a href="#tab-ch02_01_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. For example, the atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and oxygen but contains little carbon and hydrogen, while the earth&#8217;s crust, although it contains oxygen and a small amount of hydrogen, has little nitrogen and carbon. In spite of their differences in abundance, all elements and the chemical reactions between them obey the same chemical and physical laws regardless of whether they are a part of the living or non-living world.</p>

<p id="fs-idp140338798858736">To understand how elements come together, we must first discuss the smallest component or building block of an element, the atom. An <span data-type="term">atom</span> is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element. For example, one gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid metal at room temperature. A gold coin is simply a very large number of gold atoms molded into the shape of a coin and containing small amounts of other elements known as impurities. Gold atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the properties of gold.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338804724160">An atom is composed of two regions: the <span data-type="term">nucleus</span>, which is in the center of the atom and contains protons and neutrons, and the outermost region of the atom which holds its electrons in orbit around the nucleus, as illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Atoms contain protons, electrons, and neutrons, among other subatomic particles. The only exception is hydrogen (H), which is made of one proton and one electron with no neutrons.</p>
    <figure id="fig-ch02_01_01" class=" "><figcaption>Elements, such as helium, depicted here, are made up of atoms. Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons located within the nucleus, with electrons in orbitals surrounding the nucleus.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp140338808766608" data-alt="This illustration shows that, like planets orbiting the sun, electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom. The nucleus contains two neutrally charged neutrons, and two positively charged protons represented by spheres. A single, circular orbital surrounding the nucleus contains two negatively charged electrons on opposite sides.">

        </span>
</figure><p id="fs-idp140338797859808">Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, about 1.67 &#215; 10<sup>-24</sup> grams. Scientists arbitrarily define this amount of mass as one atomic mass unit (amu) or one Dalton, as shown in <a href="#tab-ch02_01_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Although similar in mass, protons and neutrons differ in their electric charge. A <span data-type="term">proton</span> is positively charged whereas a <span data-type="term">neutron</span> is uncharged. Therefore, the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass, but not to its charge. <span data-type="term">Electrons</span> are much smaller in mass than protons, weighing only 9.11 &#215; 10<sup>-28</sup> grams, or about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit. Hence, they do not contribute much to an element&#8217;s overall atomic mass. Therefore, when considering atomic mass, it is customary to ignore the mass of any electrons and calculate the atom&#8217;s mass based on the number of protons and neutrons alone. Although not significant contributors to mass, electrons do contribute greatly to the atom&#8217;s charge, as each electron has a negative charge equal to the positive charge of a proton. In uncharged, neutral atoms, the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus. In these atoms, the positive and negative charges cancel each other out, leading to an atom with no net charge.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338796885040">Accounting for the sizes of protons, neutrons, and electrons, most of the volume of an atom&#8212;greater than 99 percent&#8212;is, in fact, empty space. With all this empty space, one might ask why so-called solid objects do not just pass through one another. The reason they do not is that the electrons that surround all atoms are negatively charged and negative charges repel each other.</p>

<p id="fs-idp140338804903648">Atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons. The number of protons determines an element&#8217;s <span data-type="term">atomic number</span> and is used to distinguish one element from another. The number of neutrons is variable, resulting in isotopes, which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess. Together, the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element&#8217;s <span data-type="term">mass number</span>, as illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number. This approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number. Since an element&#8217;s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers, scientists also determine the <span data-type="term">atomic mass</span>, which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes. Often, the resulting number contains a fraction. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine (Cl) is 35.45 because chlorine is composed of several isotopes, some (the majority) with atomic mass 35 (17 protons and 18 neutrons) and some with atomic mass 37 (17 protons and 20 neutrons).</p>

<p id="eip-idm257115376"><span data-type="title">Carbon Dating</span>
Carbon is normally present in the atmosphere in the form of gaseous compounds like carbon dioxide and methane. Carbon-14 (<sup>14</sup>C) is a naturally occurring radioisotope that is created in the atmosphere from atmospheric <sup>14</sup>N (nitrogen) by the addition of a neutron and the loss of a proton because of cosmic rays. This is a continuous process, so more <sup>14</sup>C is always being created. As a living organism incorporates <sup>14</sup>C initially as carbon dioxide fixed in the process of photosynthesis, the relative amount of <sup>14</sup>C in its body is equal to the concentration of <sup>14</sup>C in the atmosphere. When an organism dies, it is no longer ingesting <sup>14</sup>C, so the ratio between <sup>14</sup>C and <sup>12</sup>C will decline as <sup>14</sup>C decays gradually to <sup>14</sup>N by a process called beta decay&#8212;the emission of electrons or positrons. This decay gives off energy in a slow process.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338807733920">After approximately 5,730 years, half of the starting concentration of <sup>14</sup>C will have been converted back to <sup>14</sup>N. The time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay back to its more stable form is called its half-life. Because the half-life of <sup>14</sup>C is long, it is used to date formerly living objects such as old bones or wood. Comparing the ratio of the <sup>14</sup>C concentration found in an object to the amount of <sup>14</sup>C detected in the atmosphere, the amount of the isotope that has not yet decayed can be determined. On the basis of this amount, the age of the material, such as the pygmy mammoth shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, can be calculated with accuracy if it is not much older than about 50,000 years. Other elements have isotopes with different half lives. For example, <sup>40</sup>K (potassium-40) has a half-life of 1.25 billion years, and <sup>235</sup>U (Uranium 235) has a half-life of about 700 million years. Through the use of radiometric dating, scientists can study the age of fossils or other remains of extinct organisms to understand how organisms have evolved from earlier species.</p>

<p id="fs-idp140338800663552">The different elements are organized and displayed in the <span data-type="term">periodic table</span>. Devised by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev (1834&#8211;1907) in 1869, the table groups elements that, although unique, share certain chemical properties with other elements. The properties of elements are responsible for their physical state at room temperature: they may be gases, solids, or liquids. Elements also have specific <span data-type="term">chemical reactivity</span>, the ability to combine and to chemically bond with each other.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338796612976">In the periodic table, shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, the elements are organized and displayed according to their atomic number and are arranged in a series of rows and columns based on shared chemical and physical properties. In addition to providing the atomic number for each element, the periodic table also displays the element&#8217;s atomic mass. Looking at carbon, for example, its symbol (C) and name appear, as well as its atomic number of six (in the upper left-hand corner) and its atomic mass of 12.11.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp140338796725872"><h1 data-type="title">Electron Shells and the Bohr Model</h1>
<p id="fs-idp140338796303120">It should be stressed that there is a connection between the number of protons in an element, the atomic number that distinguishes one element from another, and the number of electrons it has. In all electrically neutral atoms, the number of electrons is the same as the number of protons. Thus, each element, at least when electrically neutral, has a characteristic number of electrons equal to its atomic number.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338797198608">An early model of the atom was developed in 1913 by Danish scientist Niels Bohr (1885&#8211;1962). The Bohr model shows the atom as a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons, with the electrons in circular <span data-type="term">orbitals</span> at specific distances from the nucleus, as illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. These orbits form electron shells or energy levels, which are a way of visualizing the number of electrons in the outermost shells. These energy levels are designated by a number and the symbol &#8220;n.&#8221; For example, 1n represents the first energy level located closest to the nucleus.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch02_01_05" class=" "><figcaption>The Bohr model was developed by Niels Bohrs in 1913. In this model, electrons exist within principal shells. An electron normally exists in the lowest energy shell available, which is the one closest to the nucleus. Energy from a photon of light can bump it up to a higher energy shell, but this situation is unstable, and the electron quickly decays back to the ground state. In the process, a photon of light is released.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp140338797513600" data-alt="Three concentric circles around the nucleus of a hydrogen atom represent principal shells.

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-idp140338797044128">Electrons fill orbitals in a consistent order: they first fill the orbitals closest to the nucleus, then they continue to fill orbitals of increasing energy further from the nucleus. If there are multiple orbitals of equal energy, they will be filled with one electron in each energy level before a second electron is added. The electrons of the outermost energy level determine the energetic stability of the atom and its tendency to form chemical bonds with other atoms to form molecules.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338797044384">Under standard conditions, atoms fill the inner shells first, often resulting in a variable number of electrons in the outermost shell. The innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two electron shells can each have a maximum of eight electrons. This is known as the <span data-type="term">octet rule</span>, which states, with the exception of the innermost shell, that atoms are more stable energetically when they have eight electrons in their <span data-type="term">valence shell</span>, the outermost electron shell.

</div><p id="fs-idp140338806026832">Understanding that the organization of the periodic table is based on the total number of protons (and electrons) helps us know how electrons are distributed among the outer shell. The periodic table is arranged in columns and rows based on the number of electrons and where these electrons are located. Take a closer look at the some of the elements in the table&#8217;s far right column in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The group 18 atoms helium (He), neon (Ne), and argon (Ar) all have filled outer electron shells, making it unnecessary for them to share electrons with other atoms to attain stability; they are highly stable as single atoms. Their non-reactivity has resulted in their being named the <span data-type="term">inert gases</span> (or <span data-type="term">noble gases</span>). Compare this to the group 1 elements in the left-hand column. These elements, including hydrogen (H), lithium (Li), and sodium (Na), all have one electron in their outermost shells. That means that they can achieve a stable configuration and a filled outer shell by donating or sharing one electron with another atom or a molecule such as water. Hydrogen will donate or share its electron to achieve this configuration, while lithium and sodium will donate their electron to become stable. As a result of losing a negatively charged electron, they become positively charged <span data-type="term">ions</span>. Group 17 elements, including fluorine and chlorine, have seven electrons in their outmost shells, so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules, making them negatively charged ions. Group 14 elements, of which carbon is the most important to living systems, have four electrons in their outer shell allowing them to make several covalent bonds (discussed below) with other atoms. Thus, the columns of the periodic table represent the potential shared state of these elements&#8217; outer electron shells that is responsible for their similar chemical characteristics.</p>

<p id="fs-idp140338796317104">Although useful to explain the reactivity and chemical bonding of certain elements, the Bohr model of the atom does not accurately reflect how electrons are spatially distributed surrounding the nucleus. They do not circle the nucleus like the earth orbits the sun, but are found in <span data-type="term">electron orbitals</span>. These relatively complex shapes result from the fact that electrons behave not just like particles, but also like waves. Mathematical equations from quantum mechanics known as wave functions can predict within a certain level of probability where an electron might be at any given time. The area where an electron is most likely to be found is called its orbital.</p>
        <p id="fs-idp140338796636704">Recall that the Bohr model depicts an atom&#8217;s electron shell configuration. Within each electron shell are subshells, and each subshell has a specified number of orbitals containing electrons. While it is impossible to calculate exactly where an electron is located, scientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path. Subshells are designated by the letter s,<em data-effect="italics"> p</em>,<em data-effect="italics"> d</em>, and<em data-effect="italics"> f</em>.

The 1<em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbital is the closest orbital to the nucleus, and it is always filled first, before any other orbital can be filled. Hydrogen has one electron; therefore, it has only one spot within the 1<em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbital occupied. This is designated as 1<em data-effect="italics">s</em><sup>1</sup>, where the superscripted 1 refers to the one electron within the 1<em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbital.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp140338797093616"><h1 data-type="title">Ions and Ionic Bonds</h1>
<p id="fs-idp140338806167168">Some atoms are more stable when they gain or lose an electron (or possibly two) and form ions. This fills their outermost electron shell and makes them energetically more stable. Because the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons, each ion has a net charge. <span data-type="term">Cations</span> are positive ions that are formed by losing electrons. Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called anions. <span data-type="term">Anions</span> are designated by their elemental name being altered to end in &#8220;-ide&#8221;: the anion of chlorine is called chloride, and the anion of sulfur is called sulfide, for example.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338806078224"> This movement of electrons from one element to another is referred to as <span data-type="term">electron transfer</span>. As <a href="#fig-ch02_01_10" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates, sodium (Na)  only has one electron in its outer electron shell. It takes less energy for sodium to donate that one electron than it does to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell. If sodium loses an electron, it now has 11 protons, 11 neutrons, and only 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge of +1. It is now referred to as a sodium ion. Chlorine (Cl) in its lowest energy state (called the ground state) has seven electrons in its outer shell. Again, it is more energy-efficient for chlorine to gain one electron than to lose seven. Therefore, it tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons, 17 neutrons, and 18 electrons, giving it a net negative (&#8211;1) charge. It is now referred to as a chloride ion. In this example, sodium will donate its one electron to empty its shell, and chlorine will accept that electron to fill its shell. Both ions now satisfy the octet rule and have complete outermost shells. Because the number of electrons is no longer equal to the number of protons, each is now an ion and has a +1 (sodium cation) or &#8211;1 (chloride anion) charge. Note that these transactions can normally only take place simultaneously: in order for a sodium atom to lose an electron, it must be in the presence of a suitable recipient like a chlorine atom.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp140338805329568"><h1 data-type="title">Covalent Bonds and Other Bonds and Interactions</h1>
<p id="fs-idp140338803668752">Another way the octet rule can be satisfied is by the sharing of electrons between atoms to form <span data-type="term">covalent bonds</span>. These bonds are stronger and much more common than ionic bonds in the molecules of living organisms. Covalent bonds are commonly found in carbon-based organic molecules, such as our DNA and proteins. Covalent bonds are also found in inorganic molecules like H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub>. One, two, or three pairs of electrons may be shared, making single, double, and triple bonds, respectively. The more covalent bonds between two atoms, the stronger their connection. Thus, triple bonds are the strongest.</p><p id="fs-idp140338805937584">The strength of different levels of covalent bonding is one of the main reasons living organisms have a difficult time in acquiring nitrogen for use in constructing their molecules, even though molecular nitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>, is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere. Molecular nitrogen consists of two nitrogen atoms triple bonded to each other and, as with all molecules, the sharing of these three pairs of electrons between the two nitrogen atoms allows for the filling of their outer electron shells, making the molecule more stable than the individual nitrogen atoms. This strong triple bond makes it difficult for living systems to break apart this nitrogen in order to use it as constituents of proteins and DNA.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338804795680">The formation of water molecules provides an example of covalent bonding. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms that combine to form water molecules are bound together by covalent bonds, as shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_08" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The electron from the hydrogen splits its time between the incomplete outer shell of the hydrogen atoms and the incomplete outer shell of the oxygen atoms. To completely fill the outer shell of oxygen, which has six electrons in its outer shell but which would be more stable with eight, two electrons (one from each hydrogen atom) are needed: hence the well-known formula H<sub>2</sub>O. The electrons are shared between the two elements to fill the outer shell of each, making both elements more stable.</p>

</div><section data-depth="2" id="fs-idp140338797517440"><h2 data-type="title">Polar Covalent Bonds</h2>
<p id="fs-idp140338802227312">There are two types of covalent bonds: polar and nonpolar. In a <span data-type="term">polar covalent bond</span>, shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_11" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, the electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other. Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the atoms of different elements, a slightly positive (<em data-effect="italics">&#948;</em>+) or slightly negative (<em data-effect="italics">&#948;</em>&#8211;) charge develops. This partial charge is an important property of water and accounts for many of its characteristics.</p><p id="fs-idp140338804492768">Water is a polar molecule, with the hydrogen atoms acquiring a partial positive charge and the oxygen a partial negative charge. This occurs because the nucleus of the oxygen atom is more attractive to the electrons of the hydrogen atoms than the hydrogen nucleus is to the oxygen&#8217;s electrons. Thus oxygen has a higher <span data-type="term">electronegativity</span> than hydrogen and the shared electrons spend more time in the vicinity of the oxygen nucleus than they do near the nucleus of the hydrogen atoms, giving the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen slightly negative and positive charges, respectively. Another way of stating this is that the probability of finding a shared electron near an oxygen nucleus is more likely than finding it near a hydrogen nucleus. Either way, the atom&#8217;s relative electronegativity contributes to the development of partial charges whenever one element is significantly more electronegative than the other, and the charges generated by these polar bonds may then be used for the formation of hydrogen bonds based on the attraction of opposite partial charges. (Hydrogen bonds, which are discussed in detail below, are weak bonds between slightly positively charged hydrogen atoms to slightly negatively charged atoms in other molecules.) Since macromolecules often have atoms within them that differ in electronegativity, polar bonds are often present in organic molecules.</p></section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-idp140338799671424"><h2 data-type="title">Nonpolar Covalent Bonds</h2>
<p id="fs-idp140338799846288"><span data-type="term">Nonpolar covalent bonds</span> form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share electrons equally. For example, molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is nonpolar because the electrons will be equally distributed between the two oxygen atoms.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338804490560">Another example of a nonpolar covalent bond is methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), also shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_11" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Carbon has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs four more to fill it. It gets these four from four hydrogen atoms, each atom providing one, making a stable outer shell of eight electrons. Carbon and hydrogen do not have the same electronegativity but are similar; thus, nonpolar bonds form. The hydrogen atoms each need one electron for their outermost shell, which is filled when it contains two electrons. These elements share the electrons equally among the carbons and the hydrogen atoms, creating a nonpolar covalent molecule.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch02_01_11" class=" "><figcaption>Whether a molecule is polar or nonpolar depends both on bond type and molecular shape. Both water and carbon dioxide have polar covalent bonds, but carbon dioxide is linear, so the partial charges on the molecule cancel each other out.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp140338805989184" data-alt="Table compares water, methane and carbon dioxide molecules.

Likewise in carbon dioxide the oxygen has a stronger pull on electrons than carbon and the bond is polar covalent. However, water has a bent shape because two lone pairs of electrons push the hydrogen atoms together so the molecule is polar. By contrast carbon dioxide has two double bonds that repel each other, resulting in a linear shape. The polar bonds in carbon dioxide cancel each other out, resulting in a nonpolar molecule. In methane, the bond between carbon and hydrogen is nonpolar and the molecule is a symmetrical tetrahedron with hydrogens spaced as far apart as possible on the three-dimensional sphere. Since methane is symmetrical with nonpolar bonds, it is a nonpolar molecule.">

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-idp140338797683184"><h2 data-type="title">Hydrogen Bonds and Van Der Waals Interactions</h2><p id="fs-idp140338797683824">Ionic and covalent bonds between elements require energy to break.  Ionic bonds are not as strong as covalent, which determines their behavior in biological systems. However, not all bonds are ionic or covalent bonds. Weaker bonds can also form between molecules. Two weak bonds that occur frequently are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. Without these two types of bonds, life as we know it would not exist. Hydrogen bonds provide many of the critical, life-sustaining properties of water and also stabilize the structures of proteins and DNA, the building block of cells.</p><p id="fs-idp140338806173648">When polar covalent bonds containing hydrogen form, the hydrogen in that bond has a slightly positive charge because hydrogen&#8217;s electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen. Because the hydrogen is slightly positive, it will be attracted to neighboring negative charges. When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between the <em data-effect="italics">&#948;</em><sup>+</sup>of the hydrogen from one molecule and the <em data-effect="italics">&#948;</em>&#8211; charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule, usually oxygen or nitrogen, or within the same molecule. This interaction is called a <span data-type="term">hydrogen bond</span>. This type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water molecules. Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken; however, they occur in very large numbers in water and in organic polymers, creating a major force in combination. Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for zipping together the DNA double helix.</p><p id="fs-idp140338806175616">Like hydrogen bonds, <span data-type="term">van der Waals interactions</span> are weak attractions or interactions between molecules. Van der Waals attractions can occur between any two or more molecules and are dependent on slight fluctuations of the electron densities, which are not always symmetrical around an atom. For these attractions to happen, the molecules need to be very close to one another. These bonds&#8212;along with ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds&#8212;contribute to the three-dimensional structure of the proteins in our cells that is necessary for their proper function.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-idp140338804794304" class="note career" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">Career Connection</div>
<p id="eip-idp66537328"><span data-type="title">Pharmaceutical Chemist</span>
Pharmaceutical chemists are responsible for the development of new drugs and trying to determine the mode of action of both old and new drugs. They are involved in every step of the drug development process. Drugs can be found in the natural environment or can be synthesized in the laboratory. In many cases, potential drugs found in nature are changed chemically in the laboratory to make them safer and more effective, and sometimes synthetic versions of drugs substitute for the version found in nature.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338805878000">After the initial discovery or synthesis of a drug, the chemist then develops the drug, perhaps chemically altering it, testing it to see if the drug is toxic, and then designing methods for efficient large-scale production. Then, the process of getting the drug approved for human use begins. In the United States, drug approval is handled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and involves a series of large-scale experiments using human subjects to make sure the drug is not harmful and effectively treats the condition it aims to treat. This process often takes several years and requires the participation of physicians and scientists, in addition to chemists, to complete testing and gain approval.</p><p id="fs-idp140338804755008">An example of a drug that was originally discovered in a living organism is Paclitaxel (Taxol), an anti-cancer drug used to treat breast cancer. This drug was discovered in the bark of the pacific yew tree. Another example is aspirin, originally isolated from willow tree bark. Finding drugs often means testing hundreds of samples of plants, fungi, and other forms of life to see if any biologically active compounds are found within them. Sometimes, traditional medicine can give modern medicine clues to where an active compound can be found. For example, the use of willow bark to make medicine has been known for thousands of years, dating back to ancient Egypt. It was not until the late 1800s, however, that the aspirin molecule, known as acetylsalicylic acid, was purified and marketed for human use.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338806211664">Occasionally, drugs developed for one use are found to have unforeseen effects that allow these drugs to be used in other, unrelated ways. For example, the drug minoxidil (Rogaine) was originally developed to treat high blood pressure. When tested on humans, it was noticed that individuals taking the drug would grow new hair. Eventually the drug was marketed to men and women with baldness to restore lost hair.</p>
        <p id="fs-idp140338804755392">The career of the pharmaceutical chemist may involve detective work, experimentation, and drug development, all with the goal of making human beings healthier.</p>

It is made up of elements. All of the 92 elements that occur naturally have unique qualities that allow them to combine in various ways to create molecules, which in turn combine to form cells, tissues, organ systems, and organisms. Atoms, which consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons, are the smallest units of an element that retain all of the properties of that element. Electrons can be transferred, shared, or cause charge disparities between atoms to create bonds, including ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds, as well as van der Waals interactions.</p>

<p id="fs-idp41880912">Order <span data-type="term">Primates</span> of class Mammalia includes lemurs, tarsiers, monkeys, apes, and humans. Non-human primates live primarily in the tropical or subtropical regions of South America, Africa, and Asia. They range in size from the mouse lemur at 30 grams (1 ounce) to the mountain gorilla at 200 kilograms (441 pounds). The characteristics and evolution of primates is of particular interest to us as it allows us to understand the evolution of our own species.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp19098736"><h1 data-type="title">Characteristics of Primates</h1>
<p id="fs-idp129544720">All primate species possess adaptations for climbing trees, as they all descended from tree-dwellers. This arboreal heritage of primates has resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for <span data-type="term">brachiation</span>, or climbing and swinging through trees. These adaptations include, but are not limited to: 1) a rotating shoulder joint, 2) a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes and thumbs, which are widely separated from fingers (except humans), which allow for gripping branches, 3) <span data-type="term">stereoscopic vision</span>, two overlapping fields of vision from the eyes, which allows for the perception of depth and gauging distance. Other characteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of most other mammals, claws that have been modified into flattened nails, typically only one offspring per pregnancy, and a trend toward holding the body upright.</p>
<p id="fs-idp93540064">Order Primates is divided into two groups: prosimians and anthropoids. <span data-type="term">Prosimians</span> include the bush babies of Africa, the lemurs of Madagascar, and the lorises, pottos, and tarsiers of Southeast Asia. <span data-type="term">Anthropoids</span> include monkeys, apes, and humans. In general, prosimians tend to be nocturnal (in contrast to diurnal anthropoids) and exhibit a smaller size and smaller brain than anthropoids.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm56446208"><h1 data-type="title">Evolution of Primates</h1>
<p id="fs-idm10382048">The first primate-like mammals are referred to as proto-primates. They were roughly similar to squirrels and tree shrews in size and appearance. The existing fossil evidence (mostly from North Africa) is very fragmented. These proto-primates remain largely mysterious creatures until more fossil evidence becomes available. The oldest known primate-like mammals with a relatively robust fossil record is <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">Plesiadapis</em></span> (although some researchers do not agree that <em data-effect="italics">Plesiadapis</em> was a proto-primate). Fossils of this primate have been dated to approximately 55 million years ago. Plesiadapiforms were proto-primates that had some features of the teeth and skeleton in common with true primates. They were found in North America and Europe in the Cenozoic and went extinct by the end of the Eocene.</p><p id="fs-idp94790960">The first true primates were found in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa in the Eocene Epoch. These early primates resembled present-day prosimians such as lemurs. Evolutionary changes continued in these early primates, with larger brains and eyes, and smaller muzzles being the trend. By the end of the Eocene Epoch, many of the early prosimian species went extinct due either to cooler temperatures or competition from the first monkeys.</p>
<p id="fs-idm60205392">Anthropoid monkeys evolved from prosimians during the Oligocene Epoch. By 40 million years ago, evidence indicates that monkeys were present in the New World (South America) and the Old World (Africa and Asia). New World monkeys are also called <span data-type="term">Platyrrhini</span>&#8212;a reference to their broad noses (<a href="#fig-ch29_07_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Old World monkeys are called <span data-type="term">Catarrhini</span>&#8212;a reference to their narrow noses. There is still quite a bit of uncertainty about the origins of the New World monkeys. At the time the platyrrhines arose, the continents of South American and Africa had drifted apart. Therefore, it is thought that monkeys arose in the Old World and reached the New World either by drifting on log rafts or by crossing land bridges. Due to this reproductive isolation, New World monkeys and Old World monkeys underwent separate adaptive radiations over millions of years. The New World monkeys are all arboreal, whereas Old World monkeys include arboreal and ground-dwelling species.</p>

Apes are more intelligent than monkeys, and they have relatively larger brains proportionate to body size. The apes are divided into two groups. The lesser apes comprise the family <span data-type="term">Hylobatidae</span>, including gibbons and siamangs.

<p id="fs-idp13304272">The family Hominidae of order Primates includes the <span data-type="term">hominoids</span>: the great apes (<a href="#fig-ch29_07_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Evidence from the fossil record and from a comparison of human and chimpanzee DNA suggests that humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common hominoid ancestor approximately 6 million years ago. Several species evolved from the evolutionary branch that includes humans, although our species is the only surviving member. The term <span data-type="term">hominin</span> is used to refer to those species that evolved after this split of the primate line, thereby designating species that are more closely related to humans than to chimpanzees. Hominins were predominantly bipedal and include those groups that likely gave rise to our species&#8212;including <em data-effect="italics">Australopithecus</em>,<em data-effect="italics"> Homo habilis</em>, and <em data-effect="italics">Homo erectus</em>&#8212;and those non-ancestral groups that can be considered &#8220;cousins&#8221; of modern humans, such as Neanderthals. Determining the true lines of descent in hominins is difficult. In years past, when relatively few hominin fossils had been recovered, some scientists believed that considering them in order, from oldest to youngest, would demonstrate the course of evolution from early hominins to modern humans. In the past several years, however, many new fossils have been found, and it is clear that there was often more than one species alive at any one time and that many of the fossils found (and species named) represent hominin species that died out and are not ancestral to modern humans.</p>

</figure><section data-depth="2" id="fs-idm14673024"><h2 data-type="title">Very Early Hominins</h2>
<p id="fs-idp206150880">Three species of very early hominids have made news in the past few years. The oldest of these, <em data-effect="italics">Sahelanthropus tchadensis</em>, has been dated to nearly 7 million years ago. There is a single specimen of this genus, a skull that was a surface find in Chad. The fossil, informally called &#8220;Toumai,&#8221; is a mosaic of primitive and evolved characteristics, and it is unclear how this fossil fits with the picture given by molecular data, namely that the line leading to modern humans and modern chimpanzees apparently bifurcated about 6 million years ago. It is not thought at this time that this species was an ancestor of modern humans.</p>
<p id="fs-idp36109408">A second, younger species, <em data-effect="italics">Orrorin tugenensis</em>, is also a relatively recent discovery, found in 2000. There are several specimens of <em data-effect="italics">Orrorin</em>. It is not known whether <em data-effect="italics">Orrorin</em> was a human ancestor, but this possibility has not been ruled out. Some features of <em data-effect="italics">Orrorin</em> are more similar to those of modern humans than are the australopiths, although <em data-effect="italics">Orrorin </em>is much older.</p>
<p id="fs-idp56136928">A third genus, <em data-effect="italics">Ardipithecus</em>, was discovered in the 1990s, and the scientists who discovered the first fossil found that some other scientists did not believe the organism to be a biped (thus, it would not be considered a hominid). In the intervening years, several more specimens of <em data-effect="italics">Ardipithecus</em>, classified as two different species, demonstrated that the organism was bipedal. Again, the status of this genus as a human ancestor is uncertain.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-idm22448416"><h2 data-type="title">Early Hominins: Genus <em data-effect="italics">Australopithecus</em></h2>
<p id="fs-idp37739504"><span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">Australopithecus</em></span> (&#8220;southern ape&#8221;) is a genus of hominin that evolved in eastern Africa approximately 4 million years ago and went extinct about 2 million years ago. This genus is of particular interest to us as it is thought that our genus, genus <em data-effect="italics">Homo</em>, evolved from <em data-effect="italics">Australopithecus</em> about 2 million years ago (after likely passing through some transitional states). <em data-effect="italics">Australopithecus </em>had a number of characteristics that were more similar to the great apes than to modern humans. For example, sexual dimorphism was more exaggerated than in modern humans. Males were up to 50 percent larger than females, a ratio that is similar to that seen in modern gorillas and orangutans. In contrast, modern human males are approximately 15 to 20 percent larger than females. The brain size of <em data-effect="italics">Australopithecus </em>relative to its body mass was also smaller than modern humans and more similar to that seen in the great apes. A key feature that <em data-effect="italics">Australopithecus </em>had in common with modern humans was bipedalism, although it is likely that <em data-effect="italics">Australopithecus</em> also spent time in trees.

More is known about another early species, <em data-effect="italics">Australopithecus afarensis</em>, which lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago.

Mutations in mtDNA can now be used to estimate the timeline of genetic divergence. The resulting evidence suggests that all modern humans have mtDNA inherited from a common ancestor that lived in Africa about 160,000 years ago. Another approach to the molecular understanding of human evolution is to examine the Y chromosome, which is passed from father to son. This evidence suggests that all men today inherited a Y chromosome from a male that lived in Africa about 140,000 years ago.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp160774496" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Section Summary</h1><p id="fs-idp206826608">All primate species possess adaptations for climbing trees, as they all probably descended from tree-dwellers, although not all species are arboreal. Other characteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of other mammals, claws that have been modified into flattened nails, typically only one young per pregnancy, stereoscopic vision, and a trend toward holding the body upright. Primates are divided into two groups: prosimians and anthropoids. Monkeys evolved from prosimians during the Oligocene Epoch. Apes evolved from catarrhines in Africa during the Miocene Epoch. Apes are divided into the lesser apes and the greater apes. Hominins include those groups that gave rise to our species, such as <em data-effect="italics">Australopithecus</em> and <em data-effect="italics">H</em>.<em data-effect="italics"> erectus</em>, and those groups that can be considered &#8220;cousins&#8221; of humans, such as Neanderthals. Fossil evidence shows that hominins at the time of <em data-effect="italics">Australopithecus </em>were walking upright, the first evidence of bipedal hominins. A number of species, sometimes called archaic <em data-effect="italics">H</em>.<em data-effect="italics"> sapiens</em>, evolved from <em data-effect="italics">H</em>.<em data-effect="italics"> erectus</em> approximately 500,000 years ago. There is considerable debate about the origins of anatomically modern humans or <em data-effect="italics">H</em>.<em data-effect="italics"> sapiens sapiens</em>.</p>

All people past and present, along with the australopithecines, are hominins. We share the adaptation of being habitually bipedal. The earliest australopithecines very likely did not evolve until 5 million years ago. The primate fossil record for this crucial transitional period leading to australopithecines is still sketchy and somewhat confusing. By about 2.5 million years ago, there were at least two evolutionary lines of hominins descended from early australopithecines.</p>

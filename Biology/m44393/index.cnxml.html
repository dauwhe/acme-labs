<p id="fs-idm117917360">Cells are made of many complex molecules called macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids (RNA and DNA), carbohydrates, and lipids. The macromolecules are a subset of <span data-type="term">organic molecules</span> (any carbon-containing liquid, solid, or gas) that are especially important for life. The fundamental component for all of these macromolecules is carbon. The carbon atom has unique properties that allow it to form covalent bonds to as many as four different atoms, making this versatile element ideal to serve as the basic structural component, or &#8220;backbone,&#8221; of the macromolecules.</p>
<p id="fs-idm104312656">Individual carbon atoms have an incomplete outermost electron shell. With an atomic number of 6 (six electrons and six protons), the first two electrons fill the inner shell, leaving four in the second shell. Therefore, carbon atoms can form up to four covalent bonds with other atoms to satisfy the octet rule. The methane molecule provides an example: it has the chemical formula CH<sub>4</sub>. Each of its four hydrogen atoms forms a single covalent bond with the carbon atom by sharing a pair of electrons. This results in a filled outermost shell.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp10455440"><h1 data-type="title">Hydrocarbons</h1>
<p id="fs-idm23065488"><span data-type="term">Hydrocarbons</span> are organic molecules consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen, such as methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) described above. We often use hydrocarbons in our daily lives as fuels&#8212;like the propane in a gas grill or the butane in a lighter. The many covalent bonds between the atoms in hydrocarbons store a great amount of energy, which is released when these molecules are burned (oxidized). Methane, an excellent fuel, is the simplest hydrocarbon molecule, with a central carbon atom bonded to four different hydrogen atoms, as illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch02_03_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The geometry of the methane molecule, where the atoms reside in three dimensions, is determined by the shape of its electron orbitals. The carbons and the four hydrogen atoms form a shape known as a tetrahedron, with four triangular faces; for this reason, methane is described as having tetrahedral geometry.</p>
    <figure id="fig-ch02_03_01" class=" "><figcaption>Methane has a tetrahedral geometry, with each of the four hydrogen atoms spaced 109.5&#176; apart.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm144965344" data-alt="Methane, the simplest hydrocarbon, is composed of four hydrogen atoms surrounding a central carbon.

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-idp79833888">As the backbone of the large molecules of living things, hydrocarbons may exist as linear carbon chains, carbon rings, or combinations of both. Furthermore, individual carbon-to-carbon bonds may be single, double, or triple covalent bonds, and each type of bond affects the geometry of the molecule in a specific way. This three-dimensional shape or conformation of the large molecules of life (macromolecules) is critical to how they function.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-idm174673488"><h2 data-type="title">Hydrocarbon Chains</h2>
<p id="fs-idp73286688">Hydrocarbon chains are formed by successive bonds between carbon atoms and may be branched or unbranched. Furthermore, the overall geometry of the molecule is altered by the different geometries of single, double, and triple covalent bonds, illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch02_03_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The hydrocarbons ethane, ethene, and ethyne serve as examples of how different carbon-to-carbon bonds affect the geometry of the molecule. The names of all three molecules start with the prefix &#8220;eth-,&#8221; which is the prefix for two carbon hydrocarbons. The suffixes &#8220;-ane,&#8221; &#8220;-ene,&#8221; and &#8220;-yne&#8221; refer to the presence of single, double, or triple carbon-carbon bonds, respectively. Thus, propane, propene, and propyne follow the same pattern with three carbon molecules, butane, butane, and butyne for four carbon molecules, and so on. Double and triple bonds change the geometry of the molecule: single bonds allow rotation along the axis of the bond, whereas double bonds lead to a planar configuration and triple bonds to a linear one. These geometries have a significant impact on the shape a particular molecule can assume.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch02_03_02" class=" "><figcaption>When carbon forms single bonds with other atoms, the shape is tetrahedral. When two carbon atoms form a double bond, the shape is planar, or flat. Single bonds, like those found in ethane, are able to rotate. Double bonds, like those found in ethene cannot rotate, so the atoms on either side are locked in place.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm192969712" data-alt="Methane, the simplest hydrocarbon, is composed of four hydrogen atoms surrounding a central carbon.

Ethene, like ethane, is composed of two carbon atoms, but in this case the carbons are connected by a double bond. Each carbon also has two hydrogen atoms connected to it, for a total of three bonds.

<p id="fs-idp57674448">So far, the hydrocarbons we have discussed have been <span data-type="term">aliphatic hydrocarbons</span>, which consist of linear chains of carbon atoms. Another type of hydrocarbon, <span data-type="term">aromatic hydrocarbons</span>, consists of closed rings of carbon atoms. Ring structures are found in hydrocarbons, sometimes with the presence of double bonds, which can be seen by comparing the structure of cyclohexane to benzene in <a href="#fig-ch02_03_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Examples of biological molecules that incorporate the benzene ring include some amino acids and cholesterol and its derivatives, including the hormones estrogen and testosterone. The benzene ring is also found in the herbicide 2,4-D. Benzene is a natural component of crude oil and has been classified as a carcinogen. Some hydrocarbons have both aliphatic and aromatic portions; beta-carotene is an example of such a hydrocarbon.</p><figure id="fig-ch02_03_03" class=" "><figcaption>Carbon can form five-and six membered rings.

<p id="fs-idp65658144">The three-dimensional placement of atoms and chemical bonds within organic molecules is central to understanding their chemistry. Molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement (structure) of their atoms and/or chemical bonds are known as <span data-type="term">isomers</span>. <span data-type="term">Structural isomers</span> (like butane and isobutene shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_03_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">a</strong>) differ in the placement of their covalent bonds: both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties. For example, due to their different chemical properties, butane is suited for use as a fuel for cigarette lighters and torches, whereas isobutene is suited for use as a refrigerant and a propellant in spray cans.</p>

<p id="fs-idm3136624"><span data-type="term">Functional groups</span> are groups of atoms that occur within molecules and confer specific chemical properties to those molecules. They are found along the &#8220;carbon backbone&#8221; of macromolecules. This carbon backbone is formed by chains and/or rings of carbon atoms with the occasional substitution of an element such as nitrogen or oxygen. Molecules with other elements in their carbon backbone are <span data-type="term">substituted hydrocarbons</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-idp75409312">The functional groups in a macromolecule are usually attached to the carbon backbone at one or several different places along its chain and/or ring structure. Each of the four types of macromolecules&#8212;proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids&#8212;has its own characteristic set of functional groups that contributes greatly to its differing chemical properties and its function in living organisms.</p>
<p id="fs-idm191060016">A functional group can participate in specific chemical reactions. Some of the important functional groups in biological molecules are shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_03_07" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>; they include: hydroxyl, methyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, amino, phosphate, and sulfhydryl. These groups play an important role in the formation of molecules like DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Functional groups are usually classified as hydrophobic or hydrophilic depending on their charge or polarity characteristics. An example of a hydrophobic group is the non-polar methane molecule. Among the hydrophilic functional groups is the carboxyl group found in amino acids, some amino acid side chains, and the fatty acids that form triglycerides and phospholipids. This carboxyl group ionizes to release hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) from the COOH group resulting in the negatively charged COO<sup>- </sup>group; this contributes to the hydrophilic nature of whatever molecule it is found on. Other functional groups, such as the carbonyl group, have a partially negatively charged oxygen atom that may form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, again making the molecule more hydrophilic.</p>

<p id="fs-idm128086768">Carbon is unique and found in all living things because it can form up to four covalent bonds between atoms or molecules. These can be nonpolar or polar covalent bonds, and they allow for the formation of long chains of carbon molecules that combine to form proteins and DNA.</p>

</figure><p id="fs-idm33136944">Why study ecology? Perhaps you are interested in learning about the natural world and how living things have adapted to the physical conditions of their environment. Or, perhaps you&#8217;re a future physician seeking to understand the connection between human health and ecology.</p>
<p id="fs-idm128767456">Humans are a part of the ecological landscape, and human health is one important part of human interaction with our physical and living environment. Lyme disease, for instance, serves as one modern-day example of the connection between our health and the natural world (<a href="#fig-ch44_00_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). More formally known as Lyme borreliosis, Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that can be transmitted to humans when they are bitten by the deer tick (<em data-effect="italics">Ixodes scapularis</em>), which is the primary vector for this disease. However, not all deer ticks carry the bacteria that will cause Lyme disease in humans, and <em data-effect="italics">I. scapularis </em>can have other hosts besides deer. In fact, it turns out that the probability of infection depends on the type of host upon which the tick develops: a higher proportion of ticks that live on white-footed mice carry the bacterium than do ticks that live on deer. Knowledge about the environments and population densities in which the host species is abundant would help a physician or an epidemiologist better understand how Lyme disease is transmitted and how its incidence could be reduced.</p></body>

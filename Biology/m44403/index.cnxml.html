        <section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1802488"><h1 data-type="title">DNA and RNA</h1>
            <p id="fs-id2862975">The two main types of nucleic acids are <span data-type="term">deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</span> and <span data-type="term">ribonucleic acid (RNA)</span>. DNA is the genetic material found in all living organisms, ranging from single-celled bacteria to multicellular mammals. It is found in the nucleus of eukaryotes and in the organelles, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. In prokaryotes, the DNA is not enclosed in a membranous envelope.</p>
            <p id="fs-id811873">The entire genetic content of a cell is known as its genome, and the study of genomes is genomics. In eukaryotic cells but not in prokaryotes, DNA forms a complex with histone proteins to form chromatin, the substance of eukaryotic chromosomes. A chromosome may contain tens of thousands of genes. Many genes contain the information to make protein products; other genes code for RNA products. DNA controls all of the cellular activities by turning the genes &#8220;on&#8221; or &#8220;off.&#8221;</p>
            <p id="fs-id1998871">The other type of nucleic acid, RNA, is mostly involved in protein synthesis. The DNA molecules never leave the nucleus but instead use an intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell. This intermediary is the <span data-type="term">messenger RNA (mRNA)</span>. Other types of RNA&#8212;like rRNA, tRNA, and microRNA&#8212;are involved in protein synthesis and its regulation.</p>
            <p id="fs-id2904548">DNA and RNA are made up of monomers known as <span data-type="term">nucleotides</span>. The nucleotides combine with each other to form a <span data-type="term">polynucleotide</span>, DNA or RNA. Each nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose (five-carbon) sugar, and a phosphate group (<a href="#fig-ch03_05_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Each nitrogenous base in a nucleotide is attached to a sugar molecule, which is attached to one or more phosphate groups.</p><figure id="fig-ch03_05_01" class=" "><figcaption>A nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and one or more phosphate groups. Carbon residues in the pentose are numbered 1&#8242; through 5&#8242; (the prime distinguishes these residues from those in the base, which are numbered without using a prime notation). The base is attached to the 1&#8242; position of the ribose, and the phosphate is attached to the 5&#8242; position. When a polynucleotide is formed, the 5&#8242; phosphate of the incoming nucleotide attaches to the 3&#8242; hydroxyl group at the end of the growing chain. Two types of pentose are found in nucleotides, deoxyribose (found in DNA) and ribose (found in RNA). Deoxyribose is similar in structure to ribose, but it has an H instead of an OH at the 2&#8242; position. Bases can be divided into two categories: purines and pyrimidines. Purines have a double ring structure, and pyrimidines have a single ring.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id1477162" data-alt="The molecular structure of a nucleotide is shown.

Deoxyribose has an H instead of OH at the two prime position. Five kinds of base are found in nucleotides. Two of these, adenine and guanine, are purine bases with two rings fused together. The other three, cytosine, thymine and uracil, have one six-membered ring.">

                </figure><p id="fs-id1582478">The nitrogenous bases, important components of nucleotides, are organic molecules and are so named because they contain carbon and nitrogen. They are bases because they contain an amino group that has the potential of binding an extra hydrogen, and thus, decreases the hydrogen ion concentration in its environment, making it more basic. Each nucleotide in DNA contains one of four possible nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G) cytosine (C), and thymine (T).</p>
            <p id="fs-id1354194">Adenine and guanine are classified as <span data-type="term">purines</span>. The primary structure of a purine is two carbon-nitrogen rings. Cytosine, thymine, and uracil are classified as <span data-type="term">pyrimidines</span> which have a single carbon-nitrogen ring as their primary structure (<a href="#fig-ch03_05_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Each of these basic carbon-nitrogen rings has different functional groups attached to it. In molecular biology shorthand, the nitrogenous bases are simply known by their symbols A, T, G, C, and U. DNA contains A, T, G, and C whereas RNA contains A, U, G, and C.</p><p id="fs-id1445473">The pentose sugar in DNA is deoxyribose, and in RNA, the sugar is ribose (<a href="#fig-ch03_05_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The difference between the sugars is the presence of the hydroxyl group on the second carbon of the ribose and hydrogen on the second carbon of the deoxyribose. The carbon atoms of the sugar molecule are numbered as 1&#8242;, 2&#8242;, 3&#8242;, 4&#8242;, and 5&#8242; (1&#8242; is read as &#8220;one prime&#8221;). The phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5&#8242; carbon of one sugar and the hydroxyl group of the 3&#8242; carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide, which forms a 5&#8242;&#8211;3&#8242; <span data-type="term">phosphodiester</span> linkage. The phosphodiester linkage is not formed by simple dehydration reaction like the other linkages connecting monomers in macromolecules: its formation involves the removal of two phosphate groups. A polynucleotide may have thousands of such phosphodiester linkages.</p></section>

            <p id="fs-id2188236">DNA has a double-helix structure (<a href="#fig-ch03_05_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The sugar and phosphate lie on the outside of the helix, forming the backbone of the DNA. The nitrogenous bases are stacked in the interior, like the steps of a staircase, in pairs; the pairs are bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Every base pair in the double helivx is separated from the next base pair by 0.34 nm. The two strands of the helix run in opposite directions, meaning that the 5&#8242; carbon end of one strand will face the 3&#8242; carbon end of its matching strand. (This is referred to as antiparallel orientation and is important to DNA replication and in many nucleic acid interactions.)</p>

                </figure><p id="fs-id1769796">Only certain types of base pairing are allowed. For example, a certain purine can only pair with a certain pyrimidine. This means A can pair with T, and G can pair with C, as shown in <a href="#fig-ch03_05_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. This is known as the base complementary rule. In other words, the DNA strands are complementary to each other. If the sequence of one strand is AATTGGCC, the complementary strand would have the sequence TTAACCGG. During DNA replication, each strand is copied, resulting in a daughter DNA double helix containing one parental DNA strand and a newly synthesized strand.</p>

            <p id="fs-id2229626">Ribonucleic acid, or RNA, is mainly involved in the process of protein synthesis under the direction of DNA. RNA is usually single-stranded and is made of ribonucleotides that are linked by phosphodiester bonds. A ribonucleotide in the RNA chain contains ribose (the pentose sugar), one of the four nitrogenous bases (A, U, G, and C), and the phosphate group.</p>
            <p id="fs-id2626112">There are four major types of RNA: messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and microRNA (miRNA). The first, mRNA, carries the message from DNA, which controls all of the cellular activities in a cell. If a cell requires a certain protein to be synthesized, the gene for this product is turned &#8220;on&#8221; and the messenger RNA is synthesized in the nucleus. The RNA base sequence is complementary to the coding sequence of the DNA from which it has been copied. However, in RNA, the base T is absent and U is present instead. If the DNA strand has a sequence AATTGCGC, the sequence of the complementary RNA is UUAACGCG. In the cytoplasm, the mRNA interacts with ribosomes and other cellular machinery (<a href="#fig-ch03_05_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

Each nucleotide is made up of a pentose sugar, a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group. There are two types of nucleic acids: DNA and RNA. DNA carries the genetic blueprint of the cell and is passed on from parents to offspring (in the form of chromosomes). It has a double-helical structure with the two strands running in opposite directions, connected by hydrogen bonds, and complementary to each other. RNA is single-stranded and is made of a pentose sugar (ribose), a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group. RNA is involved in protein synthesis and its regulation. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is copied from the DNA, is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and contains information for the construction of proteins. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a part of the ribosomes at the site of protein synthesis, whereas transfer RNA (tRNA) carries the amino acid to the site of protein synthesis. microRNA regulates the use of mRNA for protein synthesis.</p>

                    <p id="fs-id1966470">The four types of RNA are messenger RNA, ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA, and microRNA. Messenger RNA carries the information from the DNA that controls all cellular activities. The mRNA binds to the ribosomes that are constructed of proteins and rRNA, and tRNA transfers the correct amino acid to the site of protein synthesis. microRNA regulates the availability of mRNA for translation.</p>

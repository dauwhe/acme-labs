<p id="fs-idp143799648">Stems are a part of the shoot system of a plant. They may range in length from a few millimeters to hundreds of meters, and also vary in diameter, depending on the plant type. Stems are usually above ground, although the stems of some plants, such as the potato, also grow underground. Stems may be herbaceous (soft) or woody in nature. Their main function is to provide support to the plant, holding leaves, flowers and buds; in some cases, stems also store food for the plant. A stem may be unbranched, like that of a palm tree, or it may be highly branched, like that of a magnolia tree. The stem of the plant connects the roots to the leaves, helping to transport absorbed water and minerals to different parts of the plant. It also helps to transport the products of photosynthesis, namely sugars, from the leaves to the rest of the plant.</p>
<p id="fs-idp151563680">Plant stems, whether above or below ground, are characterized by the presence of nodes and internodes (<a href="#fig-ch30_02_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). <span data-type="term">Nodes</span> are points of attachment for leaves, aerial roots, and flowers. The stem region between two nodes is called an <span data-type="term">internode</span>. The stalk that extends from the stem to the base of the leaf is the petiole. An <span data-type="term">axillary bud</span> is usually found in the axil&#8212;the area between the base of a leaf and the stem&#8212;where it can give rise to a branch or a flower. The apex (tip) of the shoot contains the apical meristem within the <span data-type="term">apical bud</span>.</p>

<p id="fs-idp15547232">The stem and other plant organs arise from the ground tissue, and are primarily made up of simple tissues formed from three types of cells: parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma cells.</p>
<p id="fs-idp12532592"><span data-type="term">Parenchyma cells</span> are the most common plant cells (<a href="#fig-ch30_02_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).

Parenchyma cells are responsible for metabolic functions, such as photosynthesis, and they help repair and heal wounds. Some parenchyma cells also store starch.</p>

Fibers are long, slender cells; sclereids are smaller-sized. Sclereids give pears their gritty texture.

<p id="fs-idp72903312">Growth in plants occurs as the stems and roots lengthen. Some plants, especially those that are woody, also increase in thickness during their life span. The increase in length of the shoot and the root is referred to as <span data-type="term">primary growth</span>, and is the result of cell division in the shoot apical meristem. <span data-type="term">Secondary growth</span> is characterized by an increase in thickness or girth of the plant, and is caused by cell division in the lateral meristem. <a href="#fig-ch30_02_07" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the areas of primary and secondary growth in a plant. Herbaceous plants mostly undergo primary growth, with hardly any secondary growth or increase in thickness.

</figure><p id="fs-idp80822112">Some plant parts, such as stems and roots, continue to grow throughout a plant&#8217;s life: a phenomenon called indeterminate growth. Other plant parts, such as leaves and flowers, exhibit determinate growth, which ceases when a plant part reaches a particular size.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-idm38920384"><h2 data-type="title">Primary Growth</h2>
<p id="fs-idp101576976">Most primary growth occurs at the apices, or tips, of stems and roots. Primary growth is a result of rapidly dividing cells in the apical meristems at the shoot tip and root tip. Subsequent cell elongation also contributes to primary growth. The growth of shoots and roots during primary growth enables plants to continuously seek water (roots) or sunlight (shoots).</p>
<p id="fs-idp12503520">The influence of the apical bud on overall plant growth is known as apical dominance, which diminishes the growth of axillary buds that form along the sides of branches and stems. Most coniferous trees exhibit strong apical dominance, thus producing the typical conical Christmas tree shape. If the apical bud is removed, then the axillary buds will start forming lateral branches. Gardeners make use of this fact when they prune plants by cutting off the tops of branches, thus encouraging the axillary buds to grow out, giving the plant a bushy shape.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-idm16521680"><h2 data-type="title">Secondary Growth</h2>
<p id="fs-idm72168320">The increase in stem thickness that results from secondary growth is due to the activity of the lateral meristems, which are lacking in herbaceous plants. Lateral meristems include the vascular cambium and, in woody plants, the cork cambium (see <a href="#fig-ch30_02_07" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The vascular cambium is located just outside the primary xylem and to the interior of the primary phloem. The cells of the vascular cambium divide and form secondary xylem (tracheids and vessel elements) to the inside, and secondary phloem (sieve elements and companion cells) to the outside. The thickening of the stem that occurs in secondary growth is due to the formation of secondary phloem and secondary xylem by the vascular cambium, plus the action of cork cambium, which forms the tough outermost layer of the stem. The cells of the secondary xylem contain lignin, which provides hardiness and strength.</p>
<p id="fs-idp47123376">In woody plants, cork cambium is the outermost lateral meristem. It produces cork cells (bark) containing a waxy substance known as suberin that can repel water. The bark protects the plant against physical damage and helps reduce water loss. The cork cambium also produces a layer of cells known as phelloderm, which grows inward from the cambium. The cork cambium, cork cells, and phelloderm are collectively termed the <span data-type="term">periderm</span>. The periderm substitutes for the epidermis in mature plants. In some plants, the periderm has many openings, known as <span data-type="term">lenticels</span>, which allow the interior cells to exchange gases with the outside atmosphere (<a href="#fig-ch30_02_08" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). This supplies oxygen to the living and metabolically active cells of the cortex, xylem and phloem.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-idp26124976"><h2 data-type="title">Annual Rings</h2>
<p id="fs-idm39929120">The activity of the vascular cambium gives rise to annual growth rings. During the spring growing season, cells of the secondary xylem have a large internal diameter and their primary cell walls are not extensively thickened. This is known as early wood, or spring wood. During the fall season, the secondary xylem develops thickened cell walls, forming late wood, or autumn wood, which is denser than early wood. This alternation of early and late wood is due largely to a seasonal decrease in the number of vessel elements and a seasonal increase in the number of tracheids. It results in the formation of an annual ring, which can be seen as a circular ring in the cross section of the stem (<a href="#fig-ch30_02_09" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). An examination of the number of annual rings and their nature (such as their size and cell wall thickness) can reveal the age of the tree and the prevailing climatic conditions during each season.</p>

<p id="fs-idm2293328">Some plant species have modified stems that are especially suited to a particular habitat and environment (<a href="#fig-ch30_02_10" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). A <span data-type="term">rhizome</span> is a modified stem that grows horizontally underground and has nodes and internodes. Vertical shoots may arise from the buds on the rhizome of some plants, such as ginger and ferns. <span data-type="term">Corms</span> are similar to rhizomes, except they are more rounded and fleshy (such as in gladiolus). Corms contain stored food that enables some plants to survive the winter. <span data-type="term">Stolons</span> are stems that run almost parallel to the ground, or just below the surface, and can give rise to new plants at the nodes. <span data-type="term">Runners</span> are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals: strawberries are an example. <span data-type="term">Tubers</span> are modified stems that may store starch, as seen in the potato (<em data-effect="italics">Solanum</em> sp.). Tubers arise as swollen ends of stolons, and contain many adventitious or unusual buds (familiar to us as the &#8220;eyes&#8221; on potatoes). A <span data-type="term">bulb</span>, which functions as an underground storage unit, is a modification of a stem that has the appearance of enlarged fleshy leaves emerging from the stem or surrounding the base of the stem, as seen in the iris.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp98815360" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Section Summary</h1><p id="fs-idm13743088">The stem of a plant bears the leaves, flowers, and fruits. Stems are characterized by the presence of nodes (the points of attachment for leaves or branches) and internodes (regions between nodes).</p>
<p id="fs-idp53004144">Plant organs are made up of simple and complex tissues. The stem has three tissue systems: dermal, vascular, and ground tissue. Dermal tissue is the outer covering of the plant. It contains epidermal cells, stomata, guard cells, and trichomes. Vascular tissue is made up of xylem and phloem tissues and conducts water, minerals, and photosynthetic products. Ground tissue is responsible for photosynthesis and support and is composed of parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma cells.</p>
<p id="fs-idm99992640">Primary growth occurs at the tips of roots and shoots, causing an increase in length. Woody plants may also exhibit secondary growth, or increase in thickness. In woody plants, especially trees, annual rings may form as growth slows at the end of each season. Some plant species have modified stems that help to store food, propagate new plants, or discourage predators. Rhizomes, corms, stolons, runners, tubers, bulbs, tendrils, and thorns are examples of modified stems.</p>

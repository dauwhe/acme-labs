<p id="fs-idm79361632">In more advanced animals, the senses are constantly at work, making the animal aware of stimuli&#8212;such as light, or sound, or the presence of a chemical substance in the external environment&#8212;and monitoring information about the organism&#8217;s internal environment. All bilaterally symmetric animals have a sensory system, and the development of any species&#8217; sensory system has been driven by natural selection; thus, sensory systems differ among species according to the demands of their environments. The shark, unlike most fish predators, is electrosensitive&#8212;that is, sensitive to electrical fields produced by other animals in its environment. While it is helpful to this underwater predator, electrosensitivity is a sense not found in most land animals.</p>

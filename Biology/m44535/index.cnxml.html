<p id="fs-idm200418880">The DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome supercoiled in the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm. Proteins that are needed for a specific function, or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway, are encoded together in blocks called <span data-type="term">operons</span>. For example, all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose (or <em data-effect="italics">lac</em>) operon.</p>
<p id="fs-idm204458112">In prokaryotic cells, there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons: repressors, activators, and inducers. <span data-type="term">Repressors</span> are proteins that suppress transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus, whereas <span data-type="term">activators</span> are proteins that increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus. Finally, inducers are small molecules that either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate.</p>

    <p id="fs-idm166815232">Bacteria such as <em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em> need amino acids to survive. <span data-type="term">Tryptophan</span> is one such amino acid that <em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em> can ingest from the environment. <em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em> can also synthesize tryptophan using enzymes that are encoded by five genes. These five genes are next to each other in what is called the <span data-type="term">tryptophan (<em data-effect="italics">trp</em>) operon</span> (<a href="#fig-ch16_02_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). If tryptophan is present in the environment, then <em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em> does not need to synthesize it and the switch controlling the activation of the genes in the <em data-effect="italics">trp</em> operon is switched off. However, when tryptophan availability is low, the switch controlling the operon is turned on, transcription is initiated, the genes are expressed, and tryptophan is synthesized.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch16_02_01"><figcaption>The five genes that are needed to synthesize tryptophan in <em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em> are located next to each other in the <em data-effect="italics">trp</em> operon.

</figure><p id="fs-idm174533984">A DNA sequence that codes for proteins is referred to as the coding region. The five coding regions for the tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes are arranged sequentially on the chromosome in the operon. Just before the coding region is the <span data-type="term">transcriptional start site</span>. This is the region of DNA to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription. The promoter sequence is upstream of the transcriptional start site; each operon has a sequence within or near the promoter to which proteins (activators or repressors) can bind and regulate transcription.</p>
<p id="fs-idm199850336">A DNA sequence called the operator sequence is encoded between the promoter region and the first <em data-effect="italics">trp</em> coding gene.

    <p id="fs-idm148740496">Just as the <em data-effect="italics">trp</em> operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules, there are proteins that bind to the operator sequences that act as a <span data-type="term">positive regulator</span> to turn genes on and activate them. For example, when glucose is scarce, <em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em> bacteria can turn to other sugar sources for fuel. To do this, new genes to process these alternate genes must be transcribed. When glucose levels drop, cyclic AMP (cAMP) begins to accumulate in the cell. The cAMP molecule is a signaling molecule that is involved in glucose and energy metabolism in <em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em>. When glucose levels decline in the cell, accumulating cAMP binds to the positive regulator <span data-type="term">catabolite activator protein (CAP)</span>, a protein that binds to the promoters of operons that control the processing of alternative sugars. When cAMP binds to CAP, the complex binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources (<a href="#fig-ch16_02_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). In these operons, a CAP binding site is located upstream of the RNA polymerase binding site in the promoter. This increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter region and the transcription of the genes.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch16_02_02"><figcaption>When glucose levels fall, <em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em> may use other sugars for fuel but must transcribe new genes to do so. As glucose supplies become limited, cAMP levels increase.

    <p id="fs-idm17029296">The third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through <span data-type="term">inducible operons</span>, which have proteins that bind to activate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell. The <em data-effect="italics">lac</em> operon is a typical inducible operon. As mentioned previously, <em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em> is able to use other sugars as energy sources when glucose concentrations are low. To do so, the cAMP&#8211;CAP protein complex serves as a positive regulator to induce transcription. One such sugar source is lactose. The <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">lac</em> operon</span> encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment. CAP binds to the operator sequence upstream of the promoter that initiates transcription of the <em data-effect="italics">lac</em> operon. However, for the <em data-effect="italics">lac</em> operon to be activated, two conditions must be met. First, the level of glucose must be very low or non-existent. Second, lactose must be present. Only when glucose is absent and lactose is present will the <em data-effect="italics">lac</em> operon be transcribed (<a href="#fig-ch16_02_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). This makes sense for the cell, because it would be energetically wasteful to create the proteins to process lactose if glucose was plentiful or lactose was not available.</p>

There are three ways to control the transcription of an operon: repressive control, activator control, and inducible control. Repressive control, typified by the<em data-effect="italics"> trp</em> operon, uses proteins bound to the operator sequence to physically prevent the binding of RNA polymerase and the activation of transcription. Therefore, if tryptophan is not needed, the repressor is bound to the operator and transcription remains off. Activator control, typified by the action of CAP, increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter when CAP is bound. In this case, low levels of glucose result in the binding of cAMP to CAP. CAP then binds the promoter, which allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter better. In the last example&#8212;the <em data-effect="italics">lac</em> operon&#8212;two conditions must be met to initiate transcription. Glucose must not be present, and lactose must be available for the <em data-effect="italics">lac</em> operon to be transcribed. If glucose is absent, CAP binds to the operator. If lactose is present, the repressor protein does not bind to its operator. Only when both conditions are met will RNA polymerase bind to the promoter to induce transcription.</p>

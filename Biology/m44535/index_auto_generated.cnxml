<para id="fs-idm200418880">The DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome supercoiled in the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm. Proteins that are needed for a specific function, or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway, are encoded together in blocks called <term>operons</term>. For example, all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose (or <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis>) operon.</para>
<para id="fs-idm204458112">In prokaryotic cells, there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons: repressors, activators, and inducers. <term>Repressors</term> are proteins that suppress transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus, whereas <term>activators</term> are proteins that increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus. Finally, inducers are small molecules that either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate.</para>

    <para id="fs-idm166815232">Bacteria such as <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> need amino acids to survive. <term>Tryptophan</term> is one such amino acid that <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> can ingest from the environment. <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> can also synthesize tryptophan using enzymes that are encoded by five genes.

<title>Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP): An Activator Regulator</title>
    <para id="fs-idm148740496">Just as the <emphasis effect="italics">trp</emphasis> operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules, there are proteins that bind to the operator sequences that act as a <term>positive regulator</term> to turn genes on and activate them. For example, when glucose is scarce, <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> bacteria can turn to other sugar sources for fuel. To do this, new genes to process these alternate genes must be transcribed. When glucose levels drop, cyclic AMP (cAMP) begins to accumulate in the cell. The cAMP molecule is a signaling molecule that is involved in glucose and energy metabolism in <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>. When glucose levels decline in the cell, accumulating cAMP binds to the positive regulator <term>catabolite activator protein (CAP)</term>, a protein that binds to the promoters of operons that control the processing of alternative sugars. When cAMP binds to CAP, the complex binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources (<link target-id="fig-ch16_02_02" document=""/>). In these operons, a CAP binding site is located upstream of the RNA polymerase binding site in the promoter. This increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter region and the transcription of the genes.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch16_02_02"><media id="fs-idm287484176" alt="The lac operon consists of a promoter, an operator, and three genes named lacZ, lacY, and lacA that are located in sequential order on the DNA. In the absence of cAMP, the CAP protein does not bind the DNA. RNA polymerase binds the promoter, and transcription occurs at a slow rate. In the presence of cAMP, a CAP&#8211;cAMP complex binds to the promoter and increases RNA polymerase activity. As a result, the rate of RNA synthesis is increased.">

<caption>When glucose levels fall, <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> may use other sugars for fuel but must transcribe new genes to do so. As glucose supplies become limited, cAMP levels increase. This cAMP binds to the CAP protein, a positive regulator that binds to an operator region upstream of the genes required to use other sugar sources.</caption></figure></section>

<title>The <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> Operon: An Inducer Operon</title>
    <para id="fs-idm17029296">The third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through <term>inducible operons</term>, which have proteins that bind to activate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell. The <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon is a typical inducible operon. As mentioned previously, <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> is able to use other sugars as energy sources when glucose concentrations are low. To do so, the cAMP&#8211;CAP protein complex serves as a positive regulator to induce transcription. One such sugar source is lactose. The <term><emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon</term> encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment. CAP binds to the operator sequence upstream of the promoter that initiates transcription of the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon. However, for the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon to be activated, two conditions must be met. First, the level of glucose must be very low or non-existent. Second, lactose must be present. Only when glucose is absent and lactose is present will the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon be transcribed (<link target-id="fig-ch16_02_03" document=""/>). This makes sense for the cell, because it would be energetically wasteful to create the proteins to process lactose if glucose was plentiful or lactose was not available.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-idm214780208">The regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic cells occurs at the transcriptional level. There are three ways to control the transcription of an operon: repressive control, activator control, and inducible control. Repressive control, typified by the<emphasis effect="italics"> trp</emphasis> operon, uses proteins bound to the operator sequence to physically prevent the binding of RNA polymerase and the activation of transcription. Therefore, if tryptophan is not needed, the repressor is bound to the operator and transcription remains off. Activator control, typified by the action of CAP, increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter when CAP is bound. In this case, low levels of glucose result in the binding of cAMP to CAP. CAP then binds the promoter, which allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter better. In the last example&#8212;the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon&#8212;two conditions must be met to initiate transcription. Glucose must not be present, and lactose must be available for the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon to be transcribed. If glucose is absent, CAP binds to the operator. If lactose is present, the repressor protein does not bind to its operator. Only when both conditions are met will RNA polymerase bind to the promoter to induce transcription.</para>
